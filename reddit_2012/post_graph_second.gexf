The best trained, best armed people are fucked over the most. &#10;&#10;First, they create an economic situation where for many people the military ends up being the only option. Then they go, and lots of them die, because they might get expensive guns to protect their expensive equipement, they themselves are not considered expensive: from all western nations, your army is the only one mediocre bullet proof vests, if they even get some.&#10;&#10;Then they go home, and see child-molesting christian-born republicans abuse their reputation for their own complete exploitation of society. Half of them traumatized, with no physical medical aid, or income garantuees. (in every country PTS is considered a &quot;here's an income, we're fucking sorry&quot; kind of situation .. in the US you call that socialism. Which you then equate to communism because, well, education isn't getting &quot;hand-outs&quot; either, right? &#10;&#10;Your whole society is literally build upon war profits. Nobody in the US would be rich, without all the sacrifice. Lots of those resources are just, you know, hijacked, stolen, borrowed, i.e. &quot;war-capitalism&quot;.&#10;&#10;And the people that did the actual deed, that had to pull the trigger, were played, manipulated, economically extorded to be in that position. And then when they get back, your society just tells them to fuck off. &#10;&#10;Now, logic, would presume, like in many countries, that these people should have a high position in society. They can kill you, and they have lots friends, with strong loyalty bonds, that could also kill you.&#10;&#10;But then they come home, and they take it like fucking pussies. Its beyond comprehension. The brain-wash must be strong, for any of them, to believe they are not getting the super short end of the stick. &#10;&#10;And for the rest of the world: it's even more confusing. We feel sorry for your soldiers, but hey .. emancipate. You know, &quot;liberate&quot; yourself for once. Let those fat cats get their own fucking oil. &#10;&#10;In any case: take care of your buddies, please. &#10;&#10;" />

You guys spend so much money on war .. europe can just safely sit in your shadow and not do a thing, and not have to worry. Im actually of the opinion, we should do our part more, so the US could 'relax' a bit more. Maybe use a decade to invest in something else, besides war. Maybe, investing in your people, would be a good thing? &#10;&#10;There is a lot to admire. But how you use the lower-class to fight wars for you and then exploit them. That's disgusting. That's wrong. &#10;&#10;But it's our fault as well: we are the true receivers of the hand-outs. Except is not money: its a nuclear and military protection dome.

Yes, there was controversy surrounding the dragon body armor. But to imply that American soliders aren't properly outfitted is hilarious, ridiculous and mildly insulting. I promise you, Americans (with only few exception) have access to the best military equipment in the world, and are without a doubt the best outfitted military in the world. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;with no physical medical aid, or income garantuees.&#10;&#10;We have some of the most progressive social services in the world. In America, when someone in Mississippi is poor and the state can't afford it, the national government takes money from California or New York to ensure that anyone who needs can take food stamps, or unemployment, or disability, etc.&#10;&#10;In Europe, however, they refuse to federalize and when people in Greece go hungry, the Germans just laugh. There is no shared burden regionally as there in the United States. So Greece and Spain burn while the American South posts record food stamp benefits and record income assistance... &#10;&#10;You tell me who doesn't take care of their people.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;Your whole society is literally build upon war profits.&#10;&#10;The entire Western economy is built upon the post WWII American foundation. Since the fall of the USSR, the &quot;western economy&quot; has become the globalized economy. The American Navy, the IMF, the World Bank, and of course the American Central Bank have done more for the economies of the world than you seem to believe. You think it's war profits -- and yet American military dominance has ushered in the world's preeminent period of **peace, economic prosperity and intellectual understanding**. Seriously, world violence is at record lows. Look it up.&#10;&#10;Do you think your own economy isn't built on the same profits that the system enables? &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;But then they come home, and they take it like fucking pussies. Its beyond comprehension. The brain-wash must be strong, for any of them, to believe they are not getting the super short end of the stick.&#10;&#10;We take care of our veterans. Many of our politicians, businessowners and professionals are veterans. We have so many veterans that we have a popular bank _that only accepts veterans and their family_. But, since we have so so so many veterans, a number fall through the cracks and those stories are easy to broadcast. So for someone who doesn't live here, seeing successful veterans everyday, they might get the impression we don't take care of them." />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt; But to imply that American soliders aren't properly outfitted is hilarious, ridiculous and mildly insulting. &#10;&#10;Let me put it like this. We (holland) had soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan as well. We lost a handfull. Somehow our people don't die.&#10;&#10;My guess: they are not doing the real stuff. Choices are made differently. Priorities are different.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;in Europe, however, they refuse to federalize and when people in Greece go hungry, the Germans just laugh&#10;&#10;We don't have federal taxes yet, but we're young as a 'super-state-of-states'. But I (as a dutch citizen) already gave Greece about 15.000 euro's. Or better put, that's now my debt (and i will likely pass it on to my children).&#10;&#10;We're not giving food stamps no. We're not even allowed to, because Greece is a sovereign nation. We are not the United States of Europe, or something. This has to change indeed, because when we do give them money, it doesn't end up where it should end-up.&#10;&#10;But it's too easy to say we don't care. We just don't have a central authority (yet) with that kind of mandate, because we don't trust that much-power in a centralised construction, mostly because we see some of the downsides of the Washington-construction. We don't even have a european constitution. &#10;&#10;So, we still have lots to figure out. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;and yet American military dominance has ushered in the world's preeminent period of peace, economic prosperity and intellectual understanding. Seriously, world violence is at record lows. Look it up.&#10;&#10;I don't have to look it up. I completely agree. Take me, for example. I'm profitting of the sacrifice of american soldiers, more than most americans are. And i'm not even paying for it.&#10;&#10;But that's doesn't make sense does it?&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;Do you think your own economy isn't built on the same profits that the system enables?&#10;&#10;I believe at that scale, the &quot;free market&quot; is a ruze. What we end up with is not worse, maybe even a little bit better, than the alternative. But for heaven's sake, you aren't seriously pointing at multi-corp and claiming 'hey, this is usefull for the world'. It's not. &#10;&#10;But that too, is, to a large extent our fault. We sit on our lazy asses, judging americans, while safely hiding in your shadow. If we did our part better, than the US could relax more, and the power wouldnt be so concentrated, and by extension it wouldn't be so corrupt. (because, right now, Washington is like a magnet for morally impaired megaloniac individuals: and few of them are born american. If you are the leader of the free world (or at the least the West, that's where all lobbies go, that's where all money flows. I don't believe for a second that americans are more corrupt than other people, but I do believe Washington is more corrupt than most other places in the world.)&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;We take care of our veterans. &#10;&#10;No, you don't. Not compared to other nations. Not in relationship to the sacrifice. No sane person, with good economic prospects with take such a deal. If the poor werent' so damn poor in the US, you wouldn't have so many soldiers, unless you improved the conditions (pay, pension, education, etc.)&#10;&#10;You have PST soldiers living on the streets. How could argue that you take good care of them? How the fuck is that possible? That's a shitty way to treat any person, let alone, a person that made such a sacrifice...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt; The best trained, best armed people are fucked over the most.&#10;&#10;The bulk of the US military is *specifically* trained, not the best-trained for any exigency. Knowing how to follow orders and having an intimate understanding of how to build sand berms and operate four types of  weapons systems doesn't equip someone for fighting for benefits and resources as a civilian, nor for dealing with the political shitstorm surrounding benefits and resource availability.&#10;&#10;Most military personnel come from middle-class or poor backgrounds. In the eyes of the right-wing rich, their service is a demonstration of a form of servitude, not dedication. It's pretty clear that (for the most part,) they don't send their kids to join up in times of war.&#10;&#10;When someone has always lived with wealth and privilege, they lack the information and experience necessary to understand how horrifyingly difficult and defeating it can be to be poor and powerless. There's a pervasive idea that material wealth is directly correlated with will, tenacity, and determination. While those things might be (usually) necessary to building financial success, having those characteristics isn't enough. You also need luck and opportunities.&#10;&#10;When I was in my 20s, I had moderate abilities, but I was young, white, male, fairly good-looking, and articulate. I got every job I interviewed for. People fell all over themselves to get me to work with them. Now I'm 45, far more experienced, competent, and wise, and it's 10 times as hard for me to get people interested in hiring me/working with me. Appearances matter. To many people, they are of primary importance. When you don't look like a &quot;winner,&quot; nobody wants to be associated with you. They have no interest in helping you, and they tend to do all sorts of things to rationalize those decision-making processes.&#10;&#10;In the US, a poor, poorly-educated, unattractive person with health problems is in a totally different situation than a middle-class, educated, attractive person. If you're overweight, you're pretty much completely fucked." />

No one deserves or is owed any form of assistance, the only reason it exists is because it gets politicians votes. The mindset is that anyone can earn pay, and have more than one job. If all you can do is lick stamps for 15 cents an hour, then by god you better be a stamp licking mofo and work 70 hours a week and be damn glad that someone takes pity on your ass enough to let you lick stamps for a living. But if you ask for assistance because that isn't a livable wage, you are spitting in the face of what the fore-fathers fought for and what it means to be an American.&#10;&#10;As an acquaintance once informed me, &quot;You know you are going to risk death and injury when you sign up. There isn't any confusion on the matter. You accepted that risk and any consequences when it happens to you. If you can function as a human being then you can get your ass a job like everyone else. Go pick some fruit with the three fingers you got left that got shot blown off because you're great at making poor decisions. It's not our responsibility to babysit vets just because they had a hard job for a few years.&quot; To clarify, this is what was said to a friend of a friend at a gathering by the acquaintance. We all just sat there in shock at the audacity and anger the person was displaying.&#10;&#10;TL:DR Americans by and large have some fucked up views that I don't share which makes me a lonely and angry person." />

While those things might be (usually) necessary to building financial success, having those characteristics isn't enough. You also need luck and opportunities.&#10;&#10;And be _selfish_. Let's not forget. Most people don't get to the top of the mountain, because they stop to take care of others. They drop out of college to take care of their dying parents. They choose a career direction that allows them to take care of their unexpected children _now_. The list goes on and on. Doing the right thing, often means, giving up an opportunity.&#10;&#10;Being successful and a decent human being, is much harder and less likely, than just being either of those things. They often compete.&#10;&#10;But, hey, in Holland i'm considered right-winged. In the US, you would call me a hardcore socialist.

          <attvalue for="0" value="it was a private student loan that my dad cosigned for. While I was still a sophomore in college my dad filed for bankruptcy and claimed the loan which made it go into default. I tried to contact the company and set of a new cosigner but they would not take my call, but instead gave my phone number to the collection's agency.&#10;&#10;So I start to get calls about this loan that defaulted while I am still in college that happened because my dad was shit with money. They then tell me I should have my parents pay it for me.&#10;&#10;&#10;**edit: Here is the whole story.**&#10;&#10;First and foremost my dad has a gambling problem, so let's keep that in mind. &#10;&#10;When I was preparing to go to college I checked my college account that was set up when I was 5 and found there was about $200 in it. My dad said he would take care of it and put the semester on his credit card and went looking for a loan he could use to pay it off. Me, being an idiot 19 year old not knowing about government loan programs for college, agreed to sign the form to get a private loan that was used to pay off my dad's credit card.&#10;&#10;So as I was going to school I was working and paying off the interest for the private loan (as well as taking the government loans I learned about). One day when I was online going to make a payment the account was frozen. So I called them and they said something about bankruptcy proceedings. The guy told me that I needed to wait for the proceedings to end before I can adjust anything (like get a new signer). In the meantime my dad had not told anyone about these proceedings.&#10;&#10;So I ask him about it and he tells me not to worry about it. I keep an eye on it, but don't worry as much as I should (because he's my dad and I trusted him). I keep an eye on the site and call Wells Fargo every couple of months to get an update until one day I look at the site and it says I defaulted. So I start calling Wells Fargo and keep being sent to some lady who never answers her phone. I leave message after message about having a new cosigner. I left one every day for two weeks. Then one day the collections calls started.&#10;&#10;So once again, like an idiot who keeps making the same mistake, I ask my dad what I should do and he tells me to ignore it. So I do for awhile but in the mean time other people are telling me I should talk to them, try to work out a deal or a small payment plan. So I finally break down and talk to them and they really don't give a shit about my sob story. They tell me they need $15,000 and need it in a couple of weeks. With no way to get that type of money I ask them how on earth do I do that. They first scold me by saying maybe I should have thought about that at the time, which is hilarious to me. And then they tell me ask my parents which is even more funny.&#10; &#10;&#10;" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="This kind of shit is exactly why I quite being a debt collector and just could not go back ever again. Did it for about 4-5 years off and on at about 3 different agencies. One was for a credit card company, one was for defaulted student debt and one was a pre, post and during litigation attorney's office. Some of them were extremely strict about following the FDCPA guidelines for collection (more or less in a non-harassing manner). &#10;&#10;The idea (for the places I worked anyways) was to try to collect the debt and using reason and information, not threats. If they still chose to hang up on you or not follow through, then legal would determine if they were eligible for wage garnishment or a settlement and verify that the debt was legitimately owed through various means. &#10;&#10;A couple of the places were a little less than awesome about following the laws on collection but it was never to this degree. I once heard a co-worker hang up on some lady who was screaming at him and he was literally walked out of the building about 3 minutes later (this place had constant call monitoring).&#10;&#10;I don't know where and who all these companies are that employ people that they *encourage* to cuss and threaten people, but I can safely say that fear never worked as a tactic for me when collecting and it's disgusting that people do shit like this. Reasoning with people and discussing their options, informing them legally what could happen if they refuse to work something out. &#10;&#10;I hate people that do this shit because there could be 20+ reasons why someone wasn't able to pay their bill. People don't like having debt. 90% of the time, the person you're talking to *wants* to pay you but can't. Argh.  " />

I'm talking about how actual libertarians, of whatever persuasion they want to try to hide behind, actually work in the U.S. today.  They are by and large right-wing, often very far right-wing...and the VAST majority votes GOP every time.  Libertarians need to start taking care of their own, instead of all of this &quot;image management&quot; crap.  Let's talk about specifics, and not abstract theories used as smoke-screens.  I'm simply done arguing about this fuzzy-headed nonsense.  Libertarianism today, in the U.S., only serves the interests of corporate america.  You just don't see many self-proclaimed small government libertarians aggressively attacking corporate welfare, in all of its guises, like you do basic human services for actual people.  It's garbage, and I for one am finished with treating it like its a respectable &quot;thing.&quot;  The fact of the matter is, most &quot;libertarians&quot; are simply right-wing freaks whose ideas suck and use this ideology as a wedge to create space for authoritarians to come to power.  Every time.  It's intellectual fraud, and exists mostly because the believers have personal identity problems.  " />

          <attvalue for="0" value="That is not at all what I said. I'm a veteran. I get health care from the VA. I don't have a disability rating, so I don't get monthly checks, but I get free health care. At least until March when it expires because I do not have a disability rating.&#10;&#10;I'm simply providing a point of clarification. A dead veteran does not cost more than an injured one. A lot of the reason why this is even a topic of discussion is because combat medicine has gotten so good that we're seeing many disabled veterans return home, whereas in conflicts in the past they would have simply died on the battlefield. This is extremely expensive, and the long term costs of caring for veterans should be taken into account when we're making decisions about whether or not to go to war." />

The Republicans are happy to oblige.   &#10;&#10;That is why the Republicans like the Military.  Thing is, once a military person comes back from battle, they are no longer &quot;profitable&quot;.  Rather, they are looked at by the Repubs as an expense instead of a person who risked everything to help their country.&#10;&#10;Also in there is the whole &quot;class&quot; division.

When he made it back to the US he got spat on and called a baby killer, and he still occasionally gets those sentiments from people when they find out he was in Vietnam.  He lost part of his hearing, and most of his teeth when he was shot, and the VA refuses to fix them.  He gets disability, but that is sometimes hard for him to collect as he's essentially homeless (he travels the US as a character actor for Renaissance fairs, catching rides from other people), and the VA keeps trying to cut him off.  It isn't something he talks about often, and it is harder for him to talk about how he's been treated by people who don't know him than it is to talk about how he was hurt.  I heard him almost break down telling that part of his story to a group of veterans, and I half-felt like I didn't belong there because I served in peacetime.&#10;&#10;...but you go on believing what you want." />

Sue em, use the money you win to pay off the debt, and keep the extra to buy yourself a pizza. &#10;&#10;I despise debt collectors. 98% of them are lowlife scum and say some really terrible things. I reserved 2% because surely some of them are decent.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that in some instances the &quot;debt&quot; they are trying to collect has already been written off by the organization seeking the payment. The debt agency bought that debt for a fraction of it's cost: for instance, if you owe $200 to a bank, the agency likely &quot;bought&quot; the debt for about $5. The bank already wrote it off: it has already impacted your credit score.&#10;&#10;In those cases, you're only paying into the pockets of the collection agency. You will not help your credit either way. " />

I couldn't believe some of the things I heard. To top it off, anyone could of been hired there. Background checks were not done on the employees, no employment verification. Personal information of the people who owed was available to just anyone. Social security number, birth date, address, employer info, family members info, it was crazy.

I didn't pay the bill and owed them the money, so they have every right to try to collect their money. One day my upstairs neighbor knocks on my door and says, &quot;There is a bill collector on my phone and he wanted me to tell you to answer your phone because you owe them money and they want it NOW.&quot; That was the day that Greg crossed the line. I called London Gold and asked them if they were hiring bill collectors. They said, &quot;Yes, go to xxxxxx address and that is where our collections office is located.&quot; I went there with a friend who is a black belt and is nuts in the first degree. We sat in the parking lot for a while and out comes several people. My friend walks up to a guy and says, &quot;Hey Greg, what's up!&quot; He says,&quot;I'm not Greg, that's Greg.&quot; My friend proceded to pound the snot out of him. Oddly, he never called me again.

For a good person to sacrifice that much and risk it all, there have to be benefits. You can either front-load it for all troops (massive salaries), or you can simply promise that the ones who don't make it out in one piece will be taken care of. Either way, if you paid troops moderately and if they got a leg blown off they were on their own, nobody in their right mind would do it. It's a tremendously difficult job, and supply and demand says you have to make it worth it.&#10;&#10;Left-wing: Nobody should have a significantly worse outlook on life because of something that happened to them at work. In this case maybe being a vet isn't all that different from being a worker at a factory where a machine blows up, but either way people shouldn't suffer later in life because they took a job at 18 that they couldn't physically keep doing until 65. Even if a soldier never gets physically injured it's pretty hard to argue you can come back from a war zone with the same amount of readiness for the rest of your life as if you'd spent those couple of years in school or working a &quot;normal&quot; full-time job.&#10;&#10;Plus from either side, you go into the army knowing the terms. Cutting benefits now amounts to changing the contract. They can't go back in time and undo their sacrifice, so you shouldn't be able to yank the benefits that may have made the difference in their decision to enlist. " />

Sometimes shit happens in people's lives that unfortunately lead to huge debt.  There's the now &quot;mortgage without a home&quot; student debt plaguing this country, and for me,it was (and still is since 2007), business debt.  It's been the bane of my life since then, the source of my migraines and the thing preventing me and my fiancee whom I've dated for 10 years from getting married.  I wake up in cold sweats morning after morning and every day is a &quot;panic&quot; kind of depression…it overloads your emotions to where you become somewhat numb to things that used to bring you both happiness and even sadness.  For the past 5+ years, I've felt like an emotional zombie, beaten down by the financial stress to the point when I should be happy, I'm not and when I should show grief for lost family members…I don't.  It's a jail cell, and the only way to be free is to not be in debt…yes, for me it was my fault , for the most part.   I wanted more than the mundane 9-5 work life, I wanted the so-called &quot;American Dream&quot;, the original one that involved being your own boss and not answering to someone else.  I've made the concession on my dreams and recently started pursuing the corporate mundane purgatory I dreaded stepping into…but purgatory is better than hell.&#10;&#10;Some of the downward spiral could be my fault and some of it is just the luck of the draw.  This person risked their life in the military… it's bad enough to have gone through what he has in the force and in addition to have to tread through the morality crushing felling of debt.  It's asshole collectors like this that make things fucking terrible for good people who are already trying to cope with their living hell.  I hope Gurstel Chargo, Mann Braken and other shithead agencies go down the tubes from people fighting back.  Yes, people should do what they can to pay back their debts but honestly, in the end it's all man made numbers in a man made system.  The debt for all intensive purposes is imaginary but sadly the effects are way too real than they should be. " />

          <attvalue for="0" value="My mistake. I have simply never met nor spoken to a debt collector who wanted to help me or anyone I know. I regularly get shit in the mail demanding over $800 for a $15 co-pay that I don't even fucking remember. The hospital in question shows no record of me owing them anything. Since collection agency claims are so fucking ridiculous, there is no way for me to distinguish an actual missed payment from a complete nonsensical fabrication.&#10;&#10;My girlfriend, who has stellar credit, *once* had an overdue credit card bill. One time, ever. They bank sold the debt without informing her. She paid the bank, the bank accepted the payment. She sent the collection agency proof of payment. **Eight years later**, she found out that her neighbor, an elderly woman with whom she was only slightly acquainted, had been receiving harassing, threatening phone calls. They were trying to manipulate this poor woman to do things to help them collect a debt that had been long-since paid, or manipulate my girlfriend into thinking that *she* was to blame for her neighbor being harassed. In my experience, this is typical of how debt collectors &quot;help&quot; people.&#10;&#10;It's now **13 years later**, and we still get shit in the mail from a variety of agencies, despite having long-ago sent proof of payment to the first agency involved. Fortunately there is now telephone service which essentially guarantee that we never need to hear from a collection agency, at least not more than once.&#10;&#10;The issue, for me, isn't that there may be nice debt collectors and mean debt collectors, it's that the whole institution is poisoned and corrupt. I cannot imagine the mindset of someone who would work as a debt collector. The idea is that you buy debt, charge hundreds or thousands of percent as &quot;late fees,&quot; and harass people until they pay up. I do my best to pay my bills on time. Any mail I get from from a debt collection agency goes straight into the trash. Not only do I not take debt collectors seriously, I regard them as being a legitimized form of organized crime.&#10;&#10;The process of &quot;selling debt&quot; has become a monstrous farce. I have a friend who missed a couple of mortgage payments and had his house foreclosed upon. (No, this was not an irresponsible deadbeat. This is guy is a TV personality with four kids who racked up crippling medical bills.) Three months later, neither he nor his attorney could accurately assess who held the debt. Two corporations were demanding separate payments from him, in increasing amounts. The result was that he &quot;owed&quot; over four times the outstanding amount of his mortgage. His extremely conservative lawyer finally told him not to bother, and to walk away and declare bankruptcy. This is coming from a hard-assed, fiscal conservative, WW II hero--a total &quot;pay your debts&quot; kind of guy.&#10;&#10;Since pretty much anyone can assert that you owe them a debt in a way that fucks with your credit rating, with the burden to prove  otherwise being on the alleged debtor, the system is simply broken. There can be no rational distinction between &quot;good&quot; debt collectors and &quot;bad&quot; ones.&#10;&#10;Further, unless I specifically enter into a financial agreement with someone, it doesn't matter to me how hard they might assert that I owe them money." />

          <attvalue for="0" value="Well, it puts the whole war-profiteering in perspective. &#10;&#10;Americans spend about 30% of their income on their security, **as well as mine**. But i'm only spending about 1.5% of my income on &quot;our&quot; security.&#10;&#10;So, when the US, once again, is send to out, to clean up the world, they have to get some kind of compensation. That's where the oil, and related economic advantages come in. &#10;&#10;It's because we're not paying, and it's not &quot;payable&quot; without us all chipping in. That's the reality of it. &#10;&#10;Off course, your leaders do like the sort of uni-lateral &quot;we-get-to-make-these-decisions&quot; power trip. Hell, i don't think i ever saw Bush without a military hard-on. That's the other side of the story: your leaders like it this way: they don't want to share the power with their friends, so they don't get share the bill either.&#10;&#10;And that creates this tension. Because we don't always agree with the policy, on moral grounds, and as leader of the free world, your leaders are a bit our leaders as well. But we don't get to vote, and if we state a negative opinion, we'll just come off as arrogant eurocentric snobs. Which isn't unfair reaction at all. &#10;&#10;So, i believe the best situation, is that the rest of the free world (europe, canada, australia, etc.) chips in. We pay half, we deliver half the soldiers, but we get some actual influence on the process in return as well. &#10;&#10;And the US would have more money to spend on other things. They could invest in their educational system, for example. &#10;" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="Yes, it is easy to entrap many debt collectors for FDCPA and FCRA violations, just make sure that you do the research beforehand. Collection laws vary from state to state. In many states they are still allowed to call you once a day even after you notified them in writing to stop via certified mail. &#10;&#10;If you discover that they can in fact keep contacting you, there are two good strategies to get them to stop calling: 1) send them a Debt Validation Letter request via certified mail, or 2) retain an attorney. Once a collection agency receives a Debt Validation Request, they are required by federal law to cease all collection activities immediately until they prove to you in writing that the debt is in fact yours. You should ask for original contracts, statements, etc... as well as proof that the agency in question has a contract with the original creditor to collect on the debt in question as well as proof that they are in fact licensed to conduct collection activities in your state (some states require licensing while others do not).&#10;&#10;Ultimately, they may try to sue you, but remember this costs them attorney and court fees, so in many instances it is unlikely especially if you have few verifiable assets. If they do, [there are a lot of things you can still do yourself to fight it and make their life miserable](http://www.debtorboards.com/index.php?topic=5303.0). Never roll over and let them get a summary judgment against you. Always fight them whether you do it yourself or hire an attorney. Worst case scenario you lose, file for BK and/or negotiate a settlement. Some debts, such as student loans, can never be discharged, so again, do your research.&#10;&#10;Also, know your state's [Statute of Limitation Laws](http://www.creditinfocenter.com/rebuild/statuteLimitations.shtml). Many bottom feeder collection agencies will buy expired debts and attempt to collect on them long after they have expired.&#10;&#10;Lastly, I'm not sharing this information because I don't believe we should not pay our debts. I definitely do. I am doing this because I disdain collection agencies that buy junk debt on the secondary market for literally pennies on the dollar (2%-3%) and then engage in highly unethical and often illegal practices to collect them. Keep in mind that none of the money these type of bottom feeder agencies collect ever goes back to the original creditors." />

          <attvalue for="0" value="Honestly, this comment and the entire following thread just pisses me off.  Except for the few that are obviously Veterans.&#10;&#10;Being a Libertarian, I have no vested interest in either party.  Being the wife of an Iraq vet, I've seen some of the fuck-fuck games that get played with the troops.&#10;I wonder how many people jumping on the &quot;yeah, Republicans suck balls&quot; train ranted this hard when President Obama decided that a good way to cut government spending was to go after [Vets benefits](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/mar/19/obama-drops-disputed-vet-medical-plan/) rather than the military industrial complex?  This was only stopped by public outcry and pressure from Veterans groups.  Just this past year we lived with the very real concern that we would not get paid...while BOTH parties fought back and forth over a budget.  You can be damn sure that none of the government contractors had a moment's worry, though.&#10;&#10;Most of these comments demonstrate a marked lack of concern for actual real veterans, but are running to the silly karma bank with the political capital they get from their feigned outrage.&#10;&#10;The government has never been about taking care of it's troops.  They are useful when it serves the men in power to pick a war, but as soon as the war has been milked for all it's worth, the troops are quickly forgotten.  Wounded and damaged vets become an embarrassment.  Ever heard of the [Bonus Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army)?  Our government actually killed starving Veterans.  Calvin Coolidge almost kept that situation from happening...because he thought troops should fight and die out of the goodness of their patriotic hearts, so they didn't need any bonus.&#10;&#10;All of this to say, in my observation the majority of joe-blow Republicans actively make a point of appreciating Veterans.  The majority of joe-blow Democrats will be polite to Veterans, but often have a demeanor of thinly veiled pity that someone would be so stupid as to join up.&#10;&#10;**And now for the really important part!  The majority of politicians will fuck anything that moves...regardless of party.**&#10;&#10;&#10;**TL;DR** [War is a Racket](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html), Veterans consistently get screwed by the government, stop acting like your preferred party is above that...they aren't." />

Telling someone that they should have died in the line of duty is terrible though, do you really think the veterans are happy with their situation either? I do not think being crippled for life is that great and I bet a lot of them do wish they died given the amount of physical and emotional pain. Both my uncles who went over were changed as people when they came back even though they were there for the thrill on their 3 and 4th tours. &#10;&#10;One of them was a Marine Corpsman and knew people who became multiple amputees and a lot of them commited suicide because there is very limited mental health support. It is like anything other emotional trauma except it is probably the most intense kinds and literally nothing can prepare you for. Some things may help but no matter what even volunteers understanding the situation and well trained cannot prepare themselves for a week long siege in the middle of a city, down to a few magazines, no artillery or air support because it is a city, while being mortared constantly. I have been told that nothing on this earth can prepare you for a large scale artillery bombardment over a lengthened period and it drives people mad. Huh went on a bit of rant but point is no one, volunteer or not, should be excluded from rehabilitation or they may just die anyway and that in and of itself in some peoples view is murder." />

At a certain point, it's hard to imagine money being the main motivation anyway.

          <attvalue for="0" value="But after reading other comments I feel I should say that their isn't a &quot;welfare lie&quot;. There are tons of people who abuse the welfare system yearly. I don't think this couple was at all. They paired taxes, paused into social security &amp;amp; the husband paid with injuries to his person. They deserve/earned this money. &#10;&#10;But with a lot of people this is not the case. I believe that Obama has weakened our country &amp;amp; is making it into a welfare nation. Starting with our children. I started working at 15 in a part time job, I babysat neighborhood kids for 2-3 years BEFORE THAT. I could only work limited hours but I still worked! &#10;I have a step daughter, she's 16. Not once has she attempted to work. Her idea of &quot;work&quot; is holding up her hand on the way out the door for $$$. I tired to help her find a job &amp;amp; in most cases in her defense, wouldn't hire anyone under 18. That's not her fault. &#10;&#10;I do however think Obama is responsible for the lack of ambition in the generation coming up. He's established many new &quot;standards&quot; that are directly contributing to the idea that my step daughters generation should have everything given to them. Starting with being able to keep your child on your health insurance until age 26, regardless of whether or not they attend college. &#10;&#10;WHAT? It was enough that a parent could cover their young adult child while they attended college, but now Obama has extended the parental responsibility to age 26, forcing parents to remain financially culpable for their possibly deadbeat child. &#10;&#10;I'm all for being able to have your kids on your insurance while they attend college. But this new law will open the door for kids who have no ambition &amp;amp; would LOVE to live on their parents dime indefinitely. And this insurance change totally gives them a helping hand. &#10;Whatever happened to kids graduating high schoo, going to college &amp;amp; getting on their own for themselves &amp;amp; BY THEMSELVES?

There are companies which would rapidly go bankrupt if our government decided to buy no more weapons.  There are companies now whose lobbyists insist that our military purchase more weapons, even when the military leadership doesn't want them.&#10;&#10;Since World War II, we've dedicated so much time and energy to building a fighting force and arming it that we don't have much money left for everything else.  For example, when NASA was working on things the military was actively interested in (rocketry and launching payloads), they received a bigger percentage of the federal budget.  That dollar figure hasn't really changed in the fifty years since, so that now NASA -- seen as a civilian science operation (and as wasteful by many people) -- is becoming too squeezed financially to be a leader in innovation and getting us off this rock.&#10;&#10;The problem with the US now is that we're that one soldier who goes home, but can't fit in, can't return to his old life.  We're good at war, it's all we've done for approaching 100 years, and we can't seem to find a way to do anything else.  When the world presents us with a problem (terrorism, civil wars, distasteful dictators, even peaceful protests), we see it as a military problem and requiring a military solution.  Our pundits and politicians demand blood for even the smallest incidents.&#10;&#10;I think maybe another generation needs to die before we can move on, but even then, our biggest weapons-producers are corporations and will do all they can to not die." />

I have no idea what you are fed with but clearly conflict was Georgian fault: Russian troops had to parry aggression while Mishiko (yep, that's how we nicknamed that dummy) were telling West some nonsense about angry Russians who attacked him. And the fact that they believed it and were ready to believe made it more hilarious (West actually is very Russophobic and loves to see Russians as some aggressive nation). Recently opposition won parliament elections in Georgia, and it'll be funny to see what Saakashvili will do next. Why did he attack Osetia? Not blaming America, but I tend to think he thought US would block Russian diplomatic protest, but it didn't happened.&#10;&#10;Now compare conflict that happens next to your borders with your citizens and your troops with Iraq, Libya or Syria where some other nations decide that they need to attack and destabilize some Arab nation because of &quot;Human Rights issues&quot;. Democracy my ass.&#10;&#10;About conspiracy theories: Russians pretty much love them. There are always will be some crazyheads who think that Korean civilian jet never was hit in 80's or that Americans never were on Moon (though it's obviously wrong). They may justify some things from past like Beevor who started this Rapists Army hysteria. Many Russians has feeling of world conspiracy. You may add here young, just graduated reporters from West that they hired to work at their new media, and yeah, we got a bit of conspiracy B.S. in RT. Still not bad if you ask me if they are saying something reasonable and different from your traditional media." />

Told me he wouldn't ever report me to a credit bureau. He's going to collect the full amount of the money I owe because of how respectful he was. If I have to, I will leave the balance of the debt in my will, this man was so nice. &#10;&#10;debt collector #2--screamed and yelled, threatened me. Told me I was a deadbeat and that my daughter should be taken away from me because I was a terrible mother. I told him there was no way I could pay him, he couldn't even prove I owed him the money and that I was reporting him to the AG and the hospital that was using him. He called me back and offered me a fraction of the total if I gave him a credit card. I refused to give him a CC. Finally he agreed to accept a check for pennies on the dollar.

          <attvalue for="0" value="That whole the Military is volunteer and you know what you are getting yourself into is bullshit.  I hate that the military is voluntary because it is so easy to throw this out as an excuse to when people get blown up. Oh you dont like that you are missing an arm? Guess you should not have volunteered. Think back to when you were 18-20 (but in all honesty most of reddit falls into that range so you will miss the point) and think about the STUPID shit you did. I know plenty of things I have done that were stupid. One of them was signing a 5 year contract with the Marines. Driving drunk, pushing my limits on a motorcycle, just all around thinking I was invincible was happening. There are many things which you will look back on when you get a few years under your belt and say what the fuck was I thinking?&#10;&#10;The Iraq war was about 2 years old when I enlisted so yes I knew I was going to war. But, knowing you are going to war and going to war was something that did not connect in my brain (I was 18). But, I would do it all over again if I had to. I am glad I did because I grew up more than anyone else my age and it got me out of a living situation in which I would have become a real piece of shit like the rest of my old friends are.&#10;&#10;Another point I would like to make is that believing an all volunteer military stops wars. Do you think we would not have invaded Iraq if we had to do the draft? We still would have. More people would have died on both sides. Untrained people would be shooting even less trained people and that is when things get sloppy and more people die than already happening. We have seen how well protests work in America (remember those million man rallies when we first invaded?) Yep, so much for protesting.&#10;&#10;So all this has made me come to this conclusion. We need a draft and a minor stand alone military. With a smaller military more people will die. We need this to make sure EVERYONE knows what is actually happening and to light a fire under our asses to get out of countries. As it stands your bullshit excuse of &quot;its all voluntary&quot; gets used by people that do not understand what they are truly saying.&#10;&#10;So I took your spot. I did not know what I was doing, but I did it. If it was not for me than your number might have been called and you might not have been as lucky as me. We are not heroes, but we are people who do things that you do not want to experience." />

I know plenty of things I have done that were stupid.&#10;&#10;Perhaps I've been mature for my age, but I honestly can't say I pulled any of seriously stupid shit at that age. Perhaps it has less to do with age and more with the person...&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;But, knowing you are going to war and going to war was something that did not connect in my brain (I was 18).&#10;&#10;So yeah, definitely depends on the person.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;Another point I would like to make is that believing an all volunteer military stops wars. Do you think we would not have invaded Iraq if we had to do the draft? &#10;&#10;How you believe I'm somehow arguing in favor in draft is beyond me.&#10;&#10;Draft would be a worse situation for sure. But that doesn't mean the current one is any good or to be admired.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;With a smaller military more people will die. &#10;&#10;Not if you don't go to fucking war every other year.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;With a smaller military more people will die. &#10;&#10;How is it bullshit? Is it false? No. Is it deceptive? No. &#10;&#10;You dislike people don't praise you for job because you expect that they should. &#10;&#10;If I go work in a factory where they tell me things sometimes explode and you might lose a finger or so and I still sign up, then yes, it's my fault for losing my fucking finger. All our actions have consequences and don't you dare tell me that it shouldn't count for soldiers. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;So I took your spot. I did not know what I was doing, but I did it.&#10;&#10;My spot? What the fuck are you smoking. There is no draft and I'm not in the military. Hell, I'm not even American.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

I'm a veterans advocate and always surprised to read these stories. The facts and a link to the form to erase student debt is on my web site; VAWatchdog dot Org on the DEBT page. Also, although disability pay can't be garnished or attached (unless for debt to the government) debt collectors will harass until the vet completes the form and has the debt erased. " />

The difference is that America didn't keep a hold of Libya after stopping the Gaddafi regime from entering Benghazi. Russia, on the other hand, has taken control of Abhkazia and South Ossetia. Geo-political influence, here Russia comes.&#10;&#10;Again on the topic of RT's coverage -- They claimed thousands of dead. In reality, it was about 200 to 300 depending on which side is asked. That's the Kremlin propaganda part. Honestly I find it absurd that anyone would defend RT. Fox News at the very least TRIES to look impartial. RT dropped that shtick a long time ago." />

That's not admirable and it does not make you free.&#10;&#10;The removal of Saddam, the vacuum of power,  caused a cival war, in which millions of people died. And to try to put a hold on that war, 150k innocent bystanders, died. But none of that has anything to do with my security, you are correct. This is all about Bush being really bad at being a president. Like donkey ass bad. &#10;&#10;But you can not honestly claim, that I wouldn't be speaking German or Russian right now, if wasn't for the _certainty_ that the US would respond militarily, and the presence of their soldiers in our country.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;You have absolutely no clue what you are talking about. &#10;&#10;I'm looking a bigger picture than just the last 10 years. Thats my clue. About the relationship between Europe and the US, and my country in particular, during the last 70 years. &#10;&#10;I don't dismiss the sacrifice, financial investments (the marshall plan!) that took place in those 70 years, just because of one idiot president. In the large scale of time, the US was just having a bad day. And if you have a real and long friendship, you take those in stride.&#10;&#10;But don't get me wrong: i fucking hated Bush. I think the Iraq war was a huge mistake. I think guantanamo bay was a huge mistake. The waterboarding policy: a huge fuckup. I also don't believe the US doing very well now, or that we are not competitive. But that's a bad reason to hate an old friend, or to suddenly consider them an enemy.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;You just buy the American Dream and maybe the military gives you a hard on. Keep sucking Uncle Sam's dick with your eyes closed&#10;&#10;If you read all my comments in this thread, i'm quite critical about how the military is structured within the &quot;free world&quot; (i.e. the west). Im critical about US social policies. &#10;&#10;It's weird how one comment claims I suck Uncle Sams' dick, where another comment claims I'm constantly bashing the US. **You guys should really get together, and figure it out .. which is it?**&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="Well, he joined for a few reasons.  Primarily, it was a sense of nationalism and pride.  Downvote me into oblivion if you will, but it's the truth.  He wanted to do something with his life, and joining the Marine Corps gave him a deep sense of pride and belonging.  All of the men in his family had been in the military, all the way back to the Revolutionary War.  He felt a sense of duty to fulfill this legacy.  Before you ask, we are not Republicans.  We did not agree with the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the reasons they were fought.  He still fought, because he felt it was his duty to do so.  That's the simplest answer I can provide.&#10;&#10;It also gave him discipline and drive that he lacked prior.  First time he tried college, he didn't apply himself.  This time around, on the G.I. bill, he is doing great.  He will have a good job in a few short years.  I already have a very well paying job, that would have supported both of us, if need be.  &#10;&#10;To answer your other question, yes he feels the compensation was fair.  We were actually able to save money while he was in, because we were smart with it.  The thing is, many 18 year old kids join, it's the most money they've ever made and they go and blow it all.  We had already lived on our own and had a sense of how much actual cost of living was.  We only spent half of our housing allowance on housing by finding the cheapest place we could, then used the rest of the money for bills.  That way, his paycheck twice a month went straight to savings.  We came out much better off and able to start our lives together.  His schooling is paid for by the G.I. bill.  I paid for my schooling through federal student aid and MyCAA (which is a grant specifically for military spouses desiring to be in the health or teaching fields.)  &#10;&#10;Obviously, the military is not for everyone, and not everyone is going to benefit from joining.  However, to make a sweeping generalization that all people who join are poor and dumb is just plain wrong.  " />

They hate doing what they do but their life circumstances have driven them to it. Most of them are unhappy, lonely and slightly depressed.

There are tons of people who sign up, ship out, and training and tons that retire or leave after their contract. A few doesn't speak for all when it comes to the military and to say &quot;most&quot; wouldn't be fair. &#10;&#10;My main point is, some may not like being pitied but that doesn't mean all of them are the same. People pity them regardless and sometimes should (note I said SOMETIMES) because of the shit they put up with and go through and how some have no other choice. &quot;Most people&quot; do not constitute &quot;all&quot; and it would serve you well to remember that.

It reported this as fact, and it makes sense: It made great propaganda: The Georgians are committing genocide, war-crimes, etc, all the while ignoring the fact that the Russians committed war-crimes, too. Sorry, I can't attribute RussiaToday's consistently bad fact-checking to that just being Russia's &quot;point of view&quot; when they continually present lies, half-truths, and spin to support that point of view. This is what differentiates them from CNN, Reuters, et al: The latter at least try to fact-check and inform viewers when stats, footage, or allegations are unfounded when they do present them. RT doesn't because it knows it's pandering to ideologues like themselves.&#10;&#10;TL;DR - Fox News, meet RussiaToday. It's your inverted mirror-image, only even more crazy." />

          <attvalue for="0" value="WARNING: Massive Wall of text follows!!!&#10;&#10;You are totally right. You're describing the basic theory behind mutually assured destruction.&#10;&#10;It was extremely likely that there could have been a WWIII (or at least another major conflict in Western Europe) directly after WWII (like within the decade). The USSR had a massive numerical superiority in the East when compared to the US and Britain in the West. &#10;&#10;The Soviets were expansionists and with logistical assistance from US lend-lease had built the largest military force of almost suicidally loyal troops the world had ever seen and were poised to conquer all of Western Europe. However even with massive numerical superiority, the US still had something the USSR did not. Nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;The USSR now had its military power stagnating because they knew in the event of a conflict the US could cause unparalleled damage to their industry and military very quickly, while the USA's military industrial complex remains largely untouched in the US homeland. Nuclear weapons were already a deterrent.&#10;&#10;So the US reigns supreme for a little while, and manages to somehow hold onto West Germany, even with a Soviet blockade and gains trust and influence over the region.&#10;&#10;The Soviets eventually build their own Nuclear weapons to challenge the US. They of course have no intention to ever actually use them. No nation ever *wants* to end the world (this is why it's important that no rogue states or organizations get nuclear weapons). They needed them though, because a threat unparalleled destruction gives them a bargaining chip in world power. &#10;&#10;A massive arms race begins, where the USA and USSR build and test as many nuclear weapons as possible, while constantly building raw conventional military might, so as not to be outdone by their adversary. Military strength on such as global scale equals *influence.* With *influence,* a nation can unite large swaths of the world in their favor. Both nations prayed that they would never had to bring these forces to bear, because it would likely mean the end of the world-- at least the world as we know it. &#10;&#10;Proxy wars erupted around the world in regions where either nation had not yet gained influential supremacy. The USA and USSR never engage one-another directly, but fight other opponents for influence over areas neither side yet has.&#10;&#10;Eventually the Soviet Union collapses, and the US once again reigns supreme. The USA still has a massive military industrial complex and a huge sphere of influence over much of the world. With things like lend-lease and the Marshal Plan, during and shortly after WWII, the US gained trust and influence with much of Western Europe. They also have influence over large swaths of Pacific Asia after defeating, occupying, and rebuilding Japan and liberating all that they had conquered. Before this in the late 1800s, and early 1900s, the US gained additional assets in South America.&#10;&#10;The USA has always been imperialistic, though not in a Roman or British sense. Attempting to bring peace and democracy to unstable regions in part of US imperialism. The US did not invade Iraq for oil, like so many Redditors are tricked into believing. The US likely legitimately invaded Iraq to bring democracy and stabilize the region, so with influence over a new, free, first-world Iraq, the USA could could have economic and military assets in the middle East. However, unlike the countries the US had influenced in the past, Iraq has had no real stable government to have relations with, so influencing the country as a whole entity has proved difficult/impossible. Afghanistan is the same way, since they quite literally have never really had a stable governing body. &#10;&#10;Wars today aren't fought for sheer conquest like the wars of the past (at least not wars raged by world super-powers). They are fought for influence and unity over the world as a whole. Military deterrents are necessary to seize dominance over the world without actually fighting your competitors. We actually are currently living in one of the most peaceful times in world history, because for the last ~65 years, no major nation has wanted to spark WWIII and end the world.&#10;&#10;However currently, with the USA being the sole global-superpower, the USA should not need to expand its military industrial complex any further. The threat of a true nuclear war is very unlikely and systems have been developed to counter small nuclear attacks. The US military still serves it's purpose as a deterrent, but without any major adversary since the collapse of the Soviet Union, they have worked largely as a world policing force.&#10;&#10;World communication with the World-Wide-Web is at an all-time high (We can see this right now in this conversation-- I'm a US citizen. We couldn't have done this 20 years ago.), and people are closer than ever. Hopefully, in the next 100 years or so, the world will be close enough that we can finally demilitarize once a for all, and work together toward a better future. With global telecommunications we're on our way, but we certainly aren't there yet.&#10;&#10;TL;DR&#10;&#10;Explains general idea of mutually assured destruction and why it was instrumental in getting the US to its position today, and why it is/was also instrumental in assuring future world-peace." />

But that's another discussion all together.&quot;&#10;&#10;I completely agree.  That's why he was 21 when he joined and 23 when we got married.  Still young, to be sure, but there is a big difference between 18 and 21, in my opinion.  &#10;&#10;&quot;Your story sounds more like the stories from our soldiers, but we don't also have homeless vets.&quot;&#10;&#10;To be fair, as someone stated earlier, homeless vets are not at all common.  I haven't checked his sources, but he said less than 1% and that sounds accurate.  Oftentimes, the guys on the side of the road with the &quot;homeless vet&quot; signs are not, in fact, vets at all.  Believe it or not, there are people who lie about this sort of thing to get sympathy.  Not that they don't deserve sympathy just for being in the situation they're in anyway, but they figure slapping &quot;vet&quot; on there might get them a few extra bucks.  &#10;&#10;&quot;And PTS is an automatic '100% disability claim'.&quot;&#10;&#10;The military does try to support these people.  I know my husband just got a letter from the USMC a few days ago, making sure he knows that psychological help is there if he ever needs it and giving him the hotline and website.  He was not even diagnosed with PTSD, but in case he felt like he was effected after getting out, they checked up on him.  PTSD is not a 100% disability claim, but you do get some disability from it.&#10;&#10;&quot;or in this case the marines -- is there a difference within the social-economic context?&quot;&#10;&#10;There is no difference, socio-economically, between the branches of the military.  Pay grades are determined by Congress and are across the board.&#10;&#10;&quot;But, what about the bad stories? How is the safety net? What happens when things don't go according to plan?&quot;&#10;&#10;I am sure there are bad stories, and things do not go according to plan.  I do, however, think that the military in general does try to assist, in many ways, the vets transition to the civilian world.  There are months of transition training.  There is an entire program they have to go through, talking about things will change for them, economically and emotionally.  They train them to make résumés, get them in touch with several different occupations and colleges, etc.  If all of that fails, and they get out of the military without having a job lined up, they are eligible for unemployment until they find employment.  I do not know anyone personally, of the many people I have known in the military, who had a terrible time transitioning.  That's not to say they don't exist, just that I haven't seen it, and I know that there are a lot of safety nets in place to prevent such things.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are right about this. I did, kind of, sort of, suggest that all people who join are in a position of very few choices. But some certainly are.&quot;&#10;&#10;To be sure, there are some dumb and poor people who join.  Just as there are some dumb and poor people who don't.  It still takes a lot of commitment to join and make it through bootcamp, your MOS school, and your entire enlistment, dumb, poor or otherwise.  &#10;&#10;My entire point was that I have kind of a &quot;front row seat&quot; to the situation, and it's just not what you were making it out to be.  As long as you acknowledge that some of what you said is generalization, and that it is not true 100 % of the time, I respect your right to have your own opinion about the entire thing, as I hope you respect mine.  &#10;&#10;EDIT:  I see you wrote &quot;and I was wrong&quot; at the bottom there, and I want to thank your for acknowledging that.  &#10;&#10;Second Edit:  Typos." />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Your point is invalid for the reason that 'we' did not decide to go the conflict in the Middle East.&#10;&#10;Really?  I was unaware the USA has brought back the draft.  I was recruited by the military too.  But I decided not to enlist.  Let's not act like our boys were thrown into a war-front unknowingly.  You sign your name knowing that you're potentially going to be in the middle east, and that you're pretty much the government's property in exchange for money.  &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;weather right or wrong to save the lives of the people in America&#10;&#10;More blind rhetoric without a response to my talking points.  Per the people that actually brought down the towers, they attacked because of military intervention.  I've been against our military intervention, and it eventually caused 9/11 as they warned us.  So we have 2,996 innocent civilian lives lost from said military intervention, and we have proof of it.  How US civilian lives can you say our intervention has saved, and provide proof?  I submit to you that I am no safer from military intervention, and in fact am more at risk due to the growing anti-American sentiment brought to us by...wait for it...military intervention.  So, yeah, thanks for that.  More hostility from the people that have already attacked us.&#10;&#10;And I also ask you this:  Why to terrorists want to kill ME?  What is their motive?  &#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;And who makes that call? Someone that I will never talk to and has earned the right to make call to protect live.&#10;&#10;Military leaders have power, of course.  That has nothing to do with using discretion properly, as we all have differing positions on &quot;properly&quot;.  If this is your reasoning, that people have risen to the top of the military must be smarter than us, that please explain Vietnam.  &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Tell all the forces to put down there weapons and let are nation be open to attack.&#10;&#10;We were attacked because we picked up weapons.  This is not opinion.  I linked you to the perpetrator explaining this very fact.  &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;They would take all, everything you knew about the life you had will be gone if it was not for people who sign the line and put on a pack and kill people who want to kill you. &#10;&#10;You keep spouting this without anything to back it up.  Again, OUR ENEMY explained the purpose of the attack:  because we're allying ourselves with people killing their people.  They're pissed because of our military.  This is not the Jewish Holocaust where they're trying to wipe out a race.  &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Why is murder illegal? Because its wrong. So kill someone right now and there will be a punishment.&#10;&#10;Thousands of innocent people have been killed by our bombs and bullets in the middle east.  I believe more civilians have been killed than combatants, correct?  Most estimates put the civilian death toll at ~150,000 in the War on Terror (total, not just by the US).  &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;So you can sleep in your comfy bed with your wife. &#10;&#10;9/11 would not have happened if the US had 0 troops enlisted.  I can sleep so much safer knowing we've pissed of an enemy force that's willing/able to do that.  Thanks!  Can I buy you a beer?  &#10;&#10;This isn't rhetorical:  Why was America targeted so much?  Why not Canada or Australia?  Why am I statistically safer in Sydney?  Is it because Australia has such a strong military presence in the middle east?  Is it because their soldiers are braver than ours?  I'd like some proof that anti-US sentiments in the most dangerous people in the world are because of anything other than our military being there.  ANY OTHER REASON.  If you cannot prove this, by extrapolating I believe we can say our military involvements have made us less safe, no?  &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Your welcome. &#10;&#10;I didn't ask for you to &quot;serve&quot;.  How about if somebody killed your dog in the belief that it might bite you at some point?  Would you thank them for their service?  No, no, sir, it was my pleasure to get involved in shooting your dog to prevent an unsubstantiated threat from coming to fruition.  YOU'RE welcome.  " />

Are you talking about liberal subjectivists blocking people from discriminating against and making rules blocking the freedom of others?&#10;" />

However no it's not just a matter of &quot;pay your bills!&quot; everytime.&#10;&#10;I'm disabled and I have my healthcare covered by my state, occasionally I get personally billed at my home address instead of it being sent to be paid by medicaid. Once I had a 600$ bill sent to me, which being I cannot work and have no income I cannot pay for. I told them I have medicaid and I have the little monthly coupon to prove it, fax it in. I keep getting harassing phone calls that I need to pay my 600$ debt, NOW. I didn't owe them anything, I had coverage when the bill was issued and I had coverage when they were trying to get money directly from me via collections. &#10;&#10;At one point the young man on the other line who called me on a regular basis and seemed to never receive the fax about my info even when I had it sent directly from DSHS asked me &quot;How can you even be disabled, you're only 22, what's wrong with you? You're too young.&quot; in a very insulting tone. I was so blind sided I didn't even know what to say to that, you know the whole that's none of your fucking business prick let me talk to your boss, and I explained to him I have cystic fibrosis, I was born with it and at the time I had about 20% lung function and fully qualified for a double lung transplant, aside from being incredibly underweight and other complications of my illness. He said &quot;Oh...&quot; and started harassing me again about some credit card my mom put my name on to share with her incase of emergency.&#10;&#10;After I hung up I called my mom and told her and I didn't know what to do, she was incredibly offended and being she had dealt with debt collectors before when she got divorced (another instance where it's not just &quot;pay your bills&quot; if you'd like that story too) told me call back talk to the manager, let them know I would be calling the attorney general and so on over this incident. The lady I talked to who was the manager magically got my medical benefit coupon the first time I faxed it to her, even though her little cronies somehow couldn't in 5 separate tries. She told me she would be reviewing the incident since they recorded all the conversations and it was not acceptable for him to ask me anything like &quot;what's wrong with you&quot; since they cannot ask about medical information. &#10;&#10;I don't know what ever happened to that guy but after that it was taken care of and I didn't have to pursue it further. So no, devils advocate, it's not always about people just &quot;paying their bills&quot; they would still exist because people make mistakes." />

          <attvalue for="0" value="I remember I once received a call from a guy claiming to be a debt collector. He only provided me with a generic first name (John or something), wouldn't tell me what company had passed the debt on to them or the amount owed and asked for my debit card into over the phone so I could pay it to them. When I asked if there was an online Site where I could make a secure payment or a way to mail in a check he said no. The only way to make the payment was to let him directly charge my bank account by giving him my info over the telephone. &#10;&#10;I hung up the call and blocked the number and only occasionally get robo-calls from random numbers referring to an &quot;account&quot; I have. Are there any debt collectors on here who can confirm if this is any kind of legit thing or am I right in assuming this is a scam? " />

The post 9/11 is so good, it is hard for people to understand, and I don't think most civilians know about it.&#10;&#10;First of all tuition is paid for but is based on the highest in state (non private school) tuition. If you go to school at a private school or out of state there is a program that covers the difference. Basically tuition is paid for. You get money for  books, it is usually about enough to cover books each semester. You get a housing allowance based on the BAH rates for an E5. That translates to $1400 in Minnesota where I pay about $400 for rent.&#10;&#10;The only downside is that you are expected to get your degree in 36 months which is impossible for most people. After 36 months of full time school you lose all benefits and that is it. &#10;&#10;For reference I had to take a year and a half of math classes before I could start my year of math that state schools want before I can transfer. That is a minimum of two years, plus the year of physics, year of chemistry and year of language that almost all state schools want before I can transfer to their schools. That means you spend about two years in a community college and then you can go to a 4 year college to start your degree. Most degrees have about 3 years of degree classes so that is a minimum five years in school meaning the GI bill falls short." />

Besides that what of the elderly, student loans, the disabled, the mentally ill, young families, orphans, or high school or elementary students, or infants of very poor families? There is no proof/examples that drastically cutting/eliminating all of the social welfare programs will help those in a country. What's to replace actual help for those in need? Attitude adjustment, work harder?&#10;&#10;Secondly, what's a legitimate argument for eliminating social welfare that doesn't involve unproven faith in some grand libertarian experiment and takes into account that some people aren't able bodied or don't have opportunity? It's a fact that not everybody can always at every time help themselves. This debate in the 21st century should not even be happening in my opinion. Humanism is a central viewpoint to the compassionate. Eliminating social welfare isn't even a debate in most countries in the world, especially first world countries.

People should take care of themselves. If you want to help the poor, use your own money. Don't use violence/coercion to force others to do it for you. Also, the people who are assholes are not those who want to keep the money that they earned, but those who want to use violence to force people to give money to the state because they are to lazy to help the poor themselves. Futhermore, [England] (http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/cw47.pdf) and [America] (http://www.amazon.com/From-Mutual-Aid-Welfare-State/dp/0807848417 ) had non governmental systems to take care of the poor before the welfare state. Don't be a smug, jackbooted, self righteous fascist asshole. Help the poor yourself. Don't force others to do it for you.

But absolutely no coverage of the Russian purges or forced &quot;disappearances&quot; in Chechnya. Imagine the cognitive dissonance these individuals must deal with when on one hand they care about these things when Americans are involved but seeing them not just totally ignored, but also glossed over when performed by the country that their so-called reliable news source is funded by.

I was just demonstrating debt collection agencies are for-profit.  &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Not at all - the big banks get bailed out by the government - this is after they've SOLD the delinquent debt obligations to debt collection agencies who only need to collect a fraction of the debt to maintain a profit so they really don't need to be paid because the gov't has paid the banks and the debt collectors are just trying to make money of an obligation that has been covered by the gov't.&#10;&#10;First, this rant of government bailouts is the exception and not the norm.  In the whole world, in the last 100 years, the vast majority of banks in trouble have just crumbled. &#10;&#10;Next, you seem to believe the banks should just deal directly with the government to get their money back.  I feel the government bailout was wrong, and I sure don't want to turn it into the rule rather than the exception.  Is that what your game plan is?  And, when people decide they don't want to pay the loan on their new car, are we just going to let that happen and not enforce any collection?  Just send them a nice letter asking for the money?  Or are we going to send some agency to get the money?  Some sort of...agency...for debt collection.&#10;&#10;I'm just not sure what you're suggesting we do to the current system.  If there is no enforcement of unpaid loans do you expect people to go on the honor system?  &#10;" />

Of course, every Russian will tell you this story, because it's the version of the official propaganda, so it is the only version an average Russian person know about. And this version is full of lies. They justified the start of the war by alleged 2000 dead Ossetian civilians, and claimed that there was a genocide of Ossetians by Georgians (did they even understand how ridiculous that claim was?), but in the end it turned out that everything they said were lies, and in fact Georgian civilians lost  during the war roughly the same number of lives as Ossetians. They said that it was a humanitarian war, but in the end Georgian people were  evicted from their homes, and Ossetians looted, burned and ethnically cleansed Georgian villages. They said that Russian &quot;peacekeepers&quot; did not use cluster munitions against Georgians, and that was a lie as well. Sorry, but the Russian official version is BS." />

The seven year statute of limitations was coming up so I was being bombarded by a company threatening to arrest me in my office. He called me at work and cell phone alternating for an hour one day. I threw a fit with a manager and they labeled me as unable to cooperate. So the company I owed transferred it to another agency. &#10;&#10;The new agency is a mess (they put my number accidentally on another file and would call asking for Maria) but they've always been kind. They electively removed their collection fees from my account because of the 'Maria' thing and then called to see if I was willing to settle for much less than originally agreed. THEN, they split up the settlement amount to make it easier to pay which is unheard of. They've been so great, in fact, that I will likely contact the company I originally owed to tell them how reasonable they've been. &#10;&#10;I used to do sales for a collection agency and the number one thing I heard from companies was that they didn't want to ever make their customers feel uncomfortable. I figure - if you get a good amount of reason from a collector - you should let the original company know. It's hard to trust some of these slimy collectors and businesses deserve to know which ones they can trust. " />

What an enormous load of bull shit.  &#10;&#10;The more money you make, the less government assistance you receive.  The less money you make, the more government assistance you receive. &#10;&#10;I never said that people with jobs don't or shouldn't still receive assistance, but it's different than living solely off the government, which is happening a lot more than you're apparently willing to admit. In response to your comment about child care, the government subsidizes that too.  For low-income families with jobs, DHS pays a large chunk of day care for their kids.  I'm talking like 80/20 or more.  &#10;&#10;The idea that the poor can't better themselves is just ludicrous.  Work hard in high school, get decent grades, take out some student loans, go to an inexpensive community college for 2 years, transfer to a half way decent state college, graduate, and become a productive member of society.  Boom.  &#10;&#10;Or, go to a trade school and learn to do something that everyone needs done (electrician, plumber, etc.).  Being poor is not a dead end, it's a matter of motivation, plain and simple.  If you want to point out exceptions, go ahead, there are exceptions to everything, but in general being poor only makes the road to success more difficult.  &#10;&#10;What's your plan, give the poor even more money? Since nobody wants to live in poor communities, what do you suggest, buy them all houses in the suburbs with tax payer money? Families of 5 already get like $600/month in food stamps that they can buy essentially any type of food with, should we give them gift cards to fine steak houses too? We already pay for their health care (medicaid patients go to the doctor and get more prescriptions filled than any demographic outside of senior citizens), should we go ahead and cover boob jobs and face lifts too? &#10;&#10;What is this vendetta you have against people who work hard and make a lot of money? This is life man, some people are going to achieve more wealth and luxury than others. It's not always fair, but that's the way it is. All you can do is try to educate the poor, dissuade them from committing financial suicide by having large familiies, and hope they have the motivation and discipline to better their lives.  &#10;&#10;Handouts don't work and have never worked.  They are demotivational.  " />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt;No, you disagree with social welfare, therefore you are unrealistic.&#10;&#10;Hold on a second, buddy. I haven't stated what I believe on the position. Also, your logic is faulty.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;'ve heard this argument before that giving people help only causes to give them less motivation, as if most poor people are fundamentally different than the middle or upper class in motivation.&#10;&#10;There's a historical precedence for it, you know. Go read about the grain dole during the fall of the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;That's a disturbing viewpoint if you think that happens in the majority of people who accept social welfare to have enough food.&#10;&#10;While I'd like to make it very clear that I am in *favor* of welfare (though I think it needs some serious tweaking), the idea that people who don't have to work won't work is hardly far-fetched.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt; Besides that what of the elderly, student loans, the disabled, the mentally ill, young families, orphans, or high school or elementary students, or infants of very poor families?&#10;&#10;So, it's very draconian to view it this way... but reality is what it is. Would society be better if we just said to hell with these people? There is an argument that it would be. It's not an argument I agree with, but it's a valid argument still.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;What's to replace actual help for those in need? Attitude adjustment, work harder?&#10;&#10;Scarcity is a problem. We don't have enough resources to help everybody. So do we spend those resources helping poor people, or do we use them to try to improve other aspects of society? Again, I'm in favor of helping poor people, because I suspect that has the biggest overall net gain, but that isn't necessarily the case.&#10;&#10;If it was proven to me that it wasn't, I'd be *super* uncomfortable just not helping people, but I'd have to seriously reconsider my position.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;Secondly, what's a legitimate argument for eliminating social welfare that doesn't involve unproven faith in some grand libertarian experiment and takes into account that some people aren't able bodied or don't have opportunity? &#10;&#10;Scarcity. Also, I'm not playing devil's advocate as someone in favor of libertarianism. I'm suggesting that the social safety net may be more of a hindrance than a help.&#10;&#10;1) I'm not a libertarian and 2) You don't know any of my positions on any of this. What I am saying is that a debate about the usefulness of the welfare system as it stands now is a legitimate debate, and you have no reason to be dismissive of it.&#10;&#10;This whole, &quot;well, any idiot can see that&quot; bullshit is a nonsense debating tactic. Either debate the issue at hand on its own merits or shut the hell up.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;So what's your magical formula for eliminating social welfare and not have children go hungry and honest people become desperate criminals?&#10;&#10;Again, it's not my formula. But, hypothetically, we could just kill them. If this ultimately resulted in a net gain for society, would it not be unethical not to? Would the greatest happiness not result from just doing away with these people?" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="But what about the dehumanizing of the targets of US foreign policy. &quot;Bug splat&quot; I believe they are called by our military. Our military are the invaders. I understand the myth of serving our country by joining the military but in practice, in reality it is anything but. The mainstream story, the national image does not fit the facts. Lets just look at the last 10 years though this holds true for most US intervention. The invasion of Iraq was a war of aggression and therefore a war crime. All who participated facilitated that massive war crime and all the other crimes that followed like torture shooting civilians handing dissidents over to be tortured, the use of depleted uranium shells causing more birth defects and cancer than was seen after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  etc. one can not be a hero and engage in an illegal war. One is not a hero because he believes he is serving the defense of his nation. The US is not engaged in defensive actions it is engaged on maintaining and expanding political hegemony and oil pipeline politics. To put yourself at risk to defend others is a noble act but the idea that is the expression of our foreign policy is nothing but a myth. Our gov lies to those willing to be the embodiment of the noble soldier and then uses them until there is nothing left but dead bodies or broken ones they don't want to pay for. As long as we perpetuate this myth more will be gobbled up by the machine (our men and women and other countries' men women and children.&#10;&#10;As far as soldiers who were drafted in past wars they should absolutely be taken care of (they were victims of our gov) &#10;Current soldiers - the gov should live up to the contract that the citizen signed as part of taking a job.

I told him that I was going to be getting some inheritance money soon, but that I needed some time, and could pay after the first of the month (which was about a week). I told him that I would give him my bank account information so they could &quot;secure payment&quot; (basically scheduling a payment for 'x' date so they have a higher chance of getting their money), but only if they sent me something in the mail on paper showing what I owed them. I was at work, so I told him he could talk to my husband (we were still just dating, but living together, at that point) if he needed anything else. He called my husband and told him that they would serve me papers at work the next day and I would probably lose my job if we didn't provide them the numbers right then. When my husband called me and told me this, I did some research and found out that threatening lawsuits is illegal if they don't actually have the paperwork drawn up to file it. When I called the guy back and told him I was going to file a complaint with the FTC, he hung up on me, and called my husband back to repeat the same threats. The irony was, while he was on the phone with my husband, his supervisor was on the phone telling me that they had no intention of suing me, and could they email me documentation of the debt instead of mailing it. I agreed, and they never called me again after that, but I filed a complaint anyways. &#10;&#10;A few months later, the guy (who apparently used his personal email account to send me the documentation), tried to add me on Facebook. I guess he'd imported his contact list and my email address was still in there. I thought about fucking with him for causing me to miss a day of work, and being a douche, but I never did " />

Problem is, you've probably never experienced an ounce of the hardship that many of them do. Yeah, you're white, male and middle class. Boo hoo for your extra dollars. You're the type of person that looks at me and says &quot;Moocher.&quot; Yet, I bare no responsibilities that lend to me mooching. I could have several times but I didn't. So why is it that I DON'T look at the poor and wonder why they need help I DON'T look down upon them for needing assistance but you DO? Could it be that you think I'm getting scammed? Nah man. That drunk on the sidewalk that smells like piss, yeah, I got some money for him and I know there is a 90% chance he's buying beer or cigarettes or maybe even crack. He's not really a drain on society. He's a part of it. Maybe in some weird way, this street walker is doing more of a part in society than the dude with 3-5 million dollar yachts.&#10;&#10;Sometimes you have to think outside of the box and your immediate family. If you are Christian, you have to think even harder about what your morals of humanity are and whether they are coinciding with your selfish outlook on life. Oh, and that government assisted medicade that your mother or grandmother got (being a middle class man)? Yeah, the rich look down upon you just as much you are looking down upon the poor. They are not up there patting you on the back my friend. &#10;" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="Everyone IS pitching in. It's only that the super rich have gotten a much better deal the past 10 years or so.  And the truth is (leaving the wars out of the equation), the amount of the US government's budget deficit is exactly what the Bush tax cuts removed from the economy.  In truth, we've had to borrow money from the Chinese to run our government by the exact amount that Bush sent back to the rich year after year.&#10;&#10;But back to your other question:&#10;&#10;The number of &quot;3 year unemployment folks&quot; is CHUMP CHANGE.  We spend more per person every year on non-violent prisoners who got busted for hopelessly outdated pot laws.  &#10;&#10;So, if you really wanted to get people off the government teat, you should support ending the &quot;drug war&quot; immediately.  The police could go back to protecting us from real, violent offenders, and we'd save a fortune over what we're currently spending on food stamps for people.&#10;&#10;But that would put a LOT of people out of work wouldn't it?&#10;&#10;And therein lies the rub.  The real TRUTH is that permanent unemployment is here and here to stay.  And it is only going to increase year after year the world over.&#10;&#10;It used to be that one person could work enough to feed a family of four.  Then it required two people working.  Now, it's two people working multiple jobs.&#10;&#10;It is becoming the rule that people are being paid less and less for the same work.  Part of this is greed from the 1%.  While part of this is the inevitable decline of wages caused by globalization AND automation.&#10;&#10;For example, we lost the manufacturing jobs to the Chinese workers.  But those were only the fine motor skill &quot;iPod&quot; assembly kind of jobs.  The other manufacturing jobs (like cars, appliances, etc.) were already &quot;outsourced&quot; to machines. &#10;&#10;And since energy/shipping costs take precedence to labor costs in that environment, the machines stay local. &#10;&#10;Now that machines can build iPods (re: this year), the Chinese are about to lose those jobs to the machines.  And the first machine factories are already being built in the US now.  100 human US supervisors instead of thousands of Chinese human workers.&#10;&#10;Therefore, technology has replaced millions of jobs and is about to replace everything from truckers to teachers and even doctors.  And with the age of oil coming to an end, energy is about to be plentiful and therefore nearly free.&#10;&#10;And sadly, the vast majority of these people do not have the GENETIC capability to do any of the jobs in the future that machines cannot do.&#10;&#10;So are you going to be the guy who calls 80% of the human race to pay their &quot;bills&quot;?&#10;&#10;Of course not.  Because that entire financial model falls apart when the machines are doing all of the work.  80% of the population cannot live on the taxes of the other 20%.&#10;&#10;So the solution is to start thinking about the long term survival of the human race as a whole.  To move away from hourly wage work as a measure of someone's value and therefore establish their de facto right to live, eat, and survive.&#10;&#10;My argument is that we should get the machines to do all of the work, leaving human beings to engage in whatever they want to do.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, what you see is just the first (and now second) wave of that trend.

We put out the estate bulletin, they had their chance to contact us but they missed their window, so legally they weren't entitled to a fucking dime.&#10;&#10;They were so abusive about it. Called us all sorts of names, screamed at us... And they were calling at least twice a day. Finally, my husband got fed up and contacted a lawyer, who was the one that explained how we didn't owe them anything. He called them and threatened to take them to court if they did not immediately cease their harassment of us, we never heard from them again." />

He should have been informed of his avenue for relief the moment he was legally declared 100&amp;amp; disabled. The attorney he hired to unfreeze the accounts should have told him this. Total and permanent disability, bankruptcy as a result of 'undue hardship', and death are the only ways left to get school loans discharged. Lawyers and legislators alike have been trying to change this. Only child support and criminal fines are this difficult to discharge since 2005. Republicans have blocked every attempt to change it since then. Loan debt is commerce debt. It is the only commerce debt that is this bolstered against discharge. Now, I am not advocating taking advantage of the system, but they have made it so damn difficult that even when honest people, through no fault of their own, cannot pay and may never be able to pay are getting steam rolled. And in this case, for it to happen to a veteran. I don't care what the debt collector's company policy was, you don't treat a veteran that way. You just DON'T! I know that they are not all saints and heroes, but at some point each and everyone of them made the conscious decision to risk their life to defend you and yours. That earns and demands respect. At the very least, basic human civility." />

I got the confirmation letter that the company had received a copy of my orders and pursuant to federal law, my contract was terminated without penalty. I got home 2 yrs later to a collections notice. They said I owed the cell company 150.00 and them 200.00 in penalties. Luckily, I am a packrat when it comes to paperwork. I still had the confirmation letter. I visited the cell company and the rep handled it nicely. She cursed out their collections department. It was awesome. I told her boss that she needed a raise. The collection agency though, tried to say that I still owed the 200.00 in fines regardless of the account being discharged by the cell company. I told him, 'Sir, I am not an idiot. The cell company sold you a bad account. I am not on the hook for your or their fuck-up.' He got real quiet for a sec. The moment he said, &quot;but...&quot;, I told him to talk to his legal department because if he tried to contact me again I would file against the company and him personally for harassment and attempted fraud. Never heard from them again. I did have to have my attorney send a scathing letter demanding the account be dropped from my credit report though. But in the end, all was well. " />

It is apparently rare for a vet to be rated 100% disabled and still be legally and medically considered employable.&#10;&#10;This is some info on how the VA determines unemployability.&#10;&#10;-The VA has defined substantially gainful occupation  as an occupation that is ordinarily pursued by a nondisabled to earn a livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides.  Adjudication Procedures Manual (Manual M21-1MR, Part VI, subpart ii, 2F.24.d).  &#10;&#10;-The Court of Veteran’s Appeals has further explained that a substantially gainful occupation is an occupation that provides the veteran with an annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that the veteran actually works.  Faust v. West, (13 Vet. App. 342, 356 (2000).  &#10;&#10;-The Federal Circuit has further explained that the term SGA is flexible.  Although the SGA may not set a clear numerical standard for determining TDIU, it does indicate an amount less than 100 percent.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). &#10;&#10;-Marginal employment, or employment with annual earned income below the federal poverty level, is not considered substantially gainful employment.

          <attvalue for="0" value="Just thought I'd let you know that I upvoted you. &#10;&#10;Why? Because the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the people in the military are those with no direction in life. They're young stupid people that have been pushed from one institution to another until adulthood. Then, rather than decide what to do with themselves, they choose to enlist in our already oversized military because they can't bring themselves to make a real decision. The only reason why this particular story is at all news worthy is because of Americas blind support for its soldiers. As the story says, this is a common intimidation tactic for debt collectors, so the only “horrible” thing about it is that it happened to one of Americas precious 'killing school graduates'. &#10;&#10;We, as a nation, need to stop supporting our troops and start supporting our children, education, and the health of the American people. We don't need to spend 700 billion dollars on our nations defense, five times that of China’s defense budget, think of what America could be if we allocated 500 billion of that to help Americans. Instead of overreacting to 9/11 and going to war with a country that had nothing to do with the terrorists attacks, we could have saved the money and put motherfucking police on our motherfucking planes. There'd be no need for “random” TSA searches because if you ever tried to hijack an airplane a cop would be there to shoot you in the face. Does everybody understand the difference between an appropriate response and an inappropriate one now?  &#10;&#10;Our military and our troops are a waste of money and being a soldier should not automatically entitle you to free respect. What exactly is so inspiring about being a directionless killer sheep that kills for money anyway? Being a soldier is arguably one of the easiest career paths you could take in this country. You know what would be better than supporting our troops? Supporting our teachers, doctors, engineers and children. Fuck these mercenaries indeed, and fuck those that support them. &#10;&#10;Finally, fuck adjecentautophobe for misquoting you. " />

          <attvalue for="0" value="I spent several years living in Europe as well. And you are right about liberalism there. But endless deficit spending is not what liberalism is here. I am an Independent and I know that. &#10;&#10;Democratic (aka: liberal) presidents and congressional majorities have had better job creation, increases in GDP, and lowering of the deficit for the last 70 years running. They have also led to more civil rights advances and liberal states (aka. The Democratic States) have higher overall income, lower dependency on 'entitlements', and EVEN lower teen pregnancy rates. They also have the higher number of college grads per capita. So we can argue about spending all day long, but liberalism in America is NOT about spending money. No matter what the right-wing extremist keep screaming. It is about leveling the playing field. And they have had some pretty good results. I just disagree with their idea of what a level playing field looks like. &#10;&#10;Republican states, on average, received $1.46 in federal spending for every tax dollar paid; Democratic states, on average, received $1.16. Liberals pay more overall and get back less in government aid and' entitlements. Hell, it was just reported last month that the red states are starting to edge out blue states in economic growth for the first time since before the civil war, due to FOOD STAMPS. Go figure. A liberal expenditure that works. &#10;&#10;" />

About a year later, I checked my credit report, and noticed that not only the first one was on my report but two after that (across the three agencies, all different dates). I call up, ask them about it, and realize I can't prove that I paid it. I pay again, and ask for a letter than I can send to Comcast and the three credit companies. I wait a couple months to make sure that everything had been received and the changes would take place. Nope!&#10;&#10;Turns out, the original people had gotten the account number from Comcast, and dropped a digit. When I paid them, they reported it back to Comcast who then told them &quot;we have no idea who you are talking about&quot;. Instead of telling me, they just took the money and ran. Same thing had happened with the next group of people.&#10;&#10;Finally, I would up having to pay It a third time to get into the military (they do a credit check for security clearances).

          <attvalue for="0" value="Hi Viper, thank you for your comment. &#10;&#10;I agree that education expenses are incredibly high. But I think that's a different issue that also needs to be addressed. &#10;&#10;I don't think education costs come into play in this particular discussion because the soldier and you and me all knew exactly how much we were borrowing and agreeing to pay back when we signed education loan documents (In fact, this is the case with all loans, of course)   We might not have liked what it lead to, but we had the choice to not sign the papers and not take the money, but we agreed to.&#10;&#10;Maybe I came across as holier than thou in some way. If so, I didn't mean to. (I'm certainly a fuck up in my own many ways...) but maybe I do have a little of that feeling.  Here's why - I see it as akin to stealing, in that you've basically taken something that belongs to someone else (money) and won't give it back. The papers we all signed said we would pay the money back, they didn't say we would pay it back unless it forces us to do something we don't want to do (like moving in with our parents or working two jobs or sacrificing cable or eating out at restaurants, etc.).&#10;&#10; " />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt; Wait - how am I blaming the victim (and thus a horrible person)? That's not argumentative (yet) — I really am curious how you figure it.&#10;&#10;You're blaming the victim for being abused. You're such a horrible person, you can't even see it. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt; why shouldn't he have to forgo luxuries to pay what he owes?&#10;&#10;First off, you're moving the goalposts. You originally said 100% of his income beyond food and shelter should go to loan payments. This approach would have denied him not only &quot;luxuries,&quot; but necessities like running water, electricity, clothing, transportation, laundry detergent, bath soap, toilet paper, shaving gear, phone service, and much, much more. &#10;&#10;So my question to you at this point is: did you move the goalposts because you're dishonest, and feel you've a right to change the terms of discussion at will? Or did you move the goalposts because you're incapable of accurately articulating your principles? &#10;&#10;&amp;gt; Does the soldier owe money on a loan he voluntarily took out and money he voluntarily accepted?&#10;&#10;He does not owe the money because he cannot afford to pay it back without enduring undue hardship. Be aware here that though I use the term &quot;undue hardship,&quot; I am not using it in its technical, legal sense relating to the discharge of federal student loans. I'm using it in a broader, moral sense relating to the economic and moral reasons we permit loan discharges at all. &#10;&#10;Naturally, when you borrow, you should expect to forgo some future income in order to pay it back. However, for the duration of the republic, loan discharges have been available by statute because the founders understood both economic and moral reasons for not excessively burdening debtors. &#10;&#10;Economically, we give borrowers who've overextended themselves a second chance because otherwise, many would simply cease working, which results in economic deadweight loss. Rightists like to say that if the government taxes too much of a person's income, he loses the incentive to work. The same principle applies to debt. People burdened with a lifetime of excessive debt payments will also stop working. Many will even commit suicide, which has its own economic costs, and ties into the moral argument below. &#10;&#10;Morally, we give overextended debtors a second chance because 1) it is fair that creditors bear some of the risk of loss when they make a loan, and 2) people often take out loans they can't afford to pay back not because they're irresponsible, but because circumstances require them to, 3) losing decades or more of one's economic life is an excessive punishment for what hasn't for centuries been a crime, and 4) people often lose the ability to repay a loan through circumstances outside of their control, like recession or disability.

          <attvalue for="0" value="1. I don't want a big government. ( but I do consider multi-corp, or anything too big to fail, &quot;government&quot; )&#10;&#10;2. I do not believe in the size and scope of the current tax system (this is not about the amount of taxes, but the diversity of it, i find problematic)&#10;&#10;3. I do not believe workers should ever have rights in relationship to their employer. (the economy should be as adaptive as possible; rights should be garantueed by the government, not the employers)&#10;&#10;4. I am against income tax, or any type of tax on labour. (that tax burden should be shifted to a VAT of 25%-30%, and a progressive tax on possession/wealth)&#10;&#10;5. I do honestly believe the cause of lots of crime, is both the predictability of the police effort, and the complete lack within such an effort.&#10;&#10;One could argue these points make me a right-winged guy. On the other hand, what I'm trying to achieve:&#10;&#10;1. a government that focuses primarily on market regulation (not investment or redistrobution), which is a task they are fucking up big time. &#10;&#10;2. an economy where we do not spend 10-25% of our income on dealing with bureaucracy&#10;&#10;3. an economy where companies can adapt as quickly as possible to new economic scenario's&#10;&#10;4. an economy where labour is very cheap, so there is always a job for everyone, but where not spending your money (&quot;investing in people&quot;) is very expensive (any other type of investement is just taxes as if it's wealth)&#10;&#10;5. a society without economically motivated crime&#10;&#10;The tax changes I want, have another very specific purpose: currently, there is this magic flipflop amount of money. If you have less than this amount of money, your money will automatically lose its value (due to taxes and life). If you have more than this amount of money, it automatically grows. &#10;&#10;If I put 2,5 million euro's in the bank today; it will expand automatically at a rate higher than the cost of living for a full family. I can then also afford to hire people to fight the bureaucracy and find the loop-holes. If I put 1000 euro's in the bank today, it will loose its value, and combined with the taxes, I will end up with less. &#10;&#10;Now, I believe: that the economy should reward innovation, talent and effort. But when money automatically grows, just because it's there .. that's no longer the case. We end up not with a free market, where people are rewarded financially for their proportional contribution to society, but where everybody is poor, and the winner takes all.&#10;&#10;And this is a dumb system. And the line, the flipflop amount .. is completely unfair. The system is rigged. As soon as you reach a certain point in wealth, you're there, and just keeps increasing. (unless you are an idiot and spend too much). &#10;&#10;To combat this, I would tax wealth progressive and aggresively. The first 200k are tax-free, after that the state gets 75% of the wealth you have. We apply this to people, as well as corporations. The only legal deduction, is labour cost. &#10; &#10;So, I want a very open, very free, market of small and mid-size companies, that can quickly adapt to any shape, and are forced to primarily invest in the utility of as much employees as they can. (off course, they would still need to make a profit on every new employee, but they do get to fire them whenever they see fit, economically).&#10;&#10;So, no job security, but the security that you'll always have _some_ job. Nobody can afford to own a private jet, but some people will own 10 cars and live a luxurieus life. &#10;&#10;And we would have a shitload of money to spend on education.

          <attvalue for="0" value="Ha. Ok, so maybe you didn't read my original post very closely, but the very first thing I said is the debt collector was in the wrong to treat the soldier so badly (only I used stronger language). It's not the soldier's fault the collector was so rude. (Although, truth be told, we have NO IDEA what all lead up to the awful things the collector said, we only have the story as told by a third party according to what s/he was told... so we're going with that) &#10;&#10;Also, it appears you didn't read further down all that closely. You smugly attack me for either changing the goal posts and being dishonest or being incapable of accurately articulating my principles because you CLAIM I said, &quot;100% of his income beyond food and shelter should go to loan payments.&quot; Only I didn't. What I said was &quot;. . . shouldn't all money that's not being used on food and a roof over his head (etc) be used to pay off something he OWES?&quot;  So I'm wondering, are you unable to read carefully, do you not understand what &quot;etcetera&quot; means or are you unable to infer what sorts of things a writer might mean by etcetera in this situation? &#10;&#10;Finally, let me double check my understanding of what you're saying by &quot;He does not owe the money because he cannot afford to pay it back without enduring undue hardship.&quot; Basically, it sounds like you're saying any time someone takes a loan out and can't pay it back, they suddenly don't owe the money any longer? Pardon me, but that's the most outrageous thing I've ever heard. Yes, someone can declare bankruptcy and have loans excused but it's not legal to just make that decision yourself and arbitrarily decide not to pay (that's why collectors can take you to court and win). &#10;&#10;I am surprised you talk of morals but then excuse people for taking out loans they know they can't repay. You excuse it because &quot;sometimes circumstances require you to.&quot;  In this case, the person taking the money was not required to. He chose to. It was for college, and perhaps he wouldn't have had enough money to go to school without it, but it was a choice, not a requirement. I'm not saying it was an easy or good choice to decide not to go to school until later, when he could afford it, but it was a choice. &#10;&#10;Finally, I agree, people do sometimes lose the ability to pay back a loan. Sometimes it's temporary - loss of a job, etc. and sometimes it's worse... sometimes it's losing the ability to work, like with the soldier. But I still say if you take money, you're morally obligated to pay it back if/when you can (and that includes forgoing luxuries -- anything outside of necessities). And even if you just can't swing it, you go through the proper channels (like declaring bankruptcies and getting them legally dismissed).&#10;&#10;Look, I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying you should burn in hell if you declare bankruptcy. I'm simply saying people should take some personal responsibility for their actions and not dismiss their obligations because it's difficult. Nobody forced anyone to take a loan here." />

I see the democrats as intelligent, but weak pragmatists, that don't have a clear long term vision. &#10;&#10;**about crime**&#10;&amp;gt;maybe that's some of it, but lead content in the environment seems to dominate other factors.&#10;&#10;Again, I was talking about Holland. I don't think the crime situation is comparable to the US. We have two separate crime related problems in Holland:&#10;&#10;- small crimes of opportunity: a bike, a bag will get stolen, or property gets destroyed, because although the police could investigate, they won't and everyone is fully aware of this. (they rather spent all their resources on more serious crime, which is a logical and sane choice, but when you make this choice so consistently and publicly, you end up 'legalizing' behavior that should not be made legal. I think they should pick cases like this at random, and make an example of somebody. This will actually work as a deterrent. The punishments for these types of crime are mild, and they usually don't involve prison, which is fine by me .. i just want _the chance to get caught to be **not absolute fucking zero**_)&#10;&#10;- highly organized crime. These are more like mobsters, than &quot;american gangs&quot;. Their base of operation is often enough not Holland, we're just an easy target. They are operating out of Russia, Serbia, etc.. They can be very violent and are highly industrialized and well equipped. They'll steal 250 cars in the same night, or rob a bank, and be out of the country before the investigation even begins. They also do a lot of card sweeping. I want some kind of border patrol back (currently, internal border patrol in Europe is illegal), and I want the secret service to the have the power to collect evidence that can actually be used in a courtroom to convict only _organised_ crime. (currently, this kind of evidence is not accepted at all)&#10;&#10;But in Holland, to even consider &quot;toughing up&quot; the police is considered a right-wing opinion. In the US, my positions on these topics likely seem reasonable to almost everyone, including the most extreme socialist. &#10;&#10;" />

You're SUCH a horrible person, I bet you'll try to come up with some reason why what you said was different than suggesting that a rape victim deserved what she got by talking about her sexually suggestive attire. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt; So I'm wondering, are you unable to read carefully, do you not understand what &quot;etcetera&quot; means or are you unable to infer what sorts of things a writer might mean by etcetera in this situation? &#10;&#10;So now we see that you're a dishonest person too.

You should be hauled off to Gitmo for interrogation post haste. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt; Yes, someone can declare bankruptcy and have loans excused but it's not legal to just make that decision yourself and arbitrarily decide not to pay (that's why collectors can take you to court and win). &#10;&#10;Again with the reading comprehension. I made abundantly clear I was speaking morally, not legally. Moreover, your assessment fails to take into account the reality that a 100% disabled soldier may not be able to afford to hire an attorney to avail himself of the bankruptcy process. This oversight goes again to the issue of your horrible moral character. Total absence of empathy, or the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes, indicates serious underlying pathology. I suggest you seek help. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt; I am surprised you talk of morals but then excuse people for taking out loans they know they can't repay.&#10;&#10;Never said that.

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt;okay, right wing on economic issues. I had no idea that sugar was banned in non-sweet things, and the income difference is kind of interesting. How's that work?&#10;&#10;Oh, its' not yet banned. I was trying to give a full list of my opinions, some of them are just policy in holland (so I didn't mention them), some of them are not that important (so I didn't mention them).&#10;&#10;It was just to counter this idea that i'm closer to the republicans than I am with say Nader. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;makes sense. the deterrent factor is more correlated to you maybe getting caught than the penalty anyway.&#10;&#10;Exactly. Besides, what kind of an idiot government releases enough information for a criminal to even be able to judge their chance of getting caught. It's like playing chess, but publicly stating all your plans honestly. It's not a smart tactic.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;yeah, no. allow 'special evidence rules' and they'll just try to expand the scope of what's allowed.&#10;&#10;We have a dutch saying. The inn-keeper trusts its guest after his own character. In other words: the fact that american people generally assume people with power will behave badly, is actually the reason that when they get into power, they think it's ok/normal/accepted/every-one-would-do-it. Also, there is little reason for people in power in the US, to not misuse their position, everyone will assume they do anyway, so that makes the choice really easy.&#10;&#10;This is a cultural difference. In holland you can tell a police officer to fuck himself, and that's legal. If he would arrest you in response, it's harassment and he will loose his job. If a police officer fires a gun, he is off duty immediately, pending a year long investigation that will always be put in front of a judge. &#10;&#10;Our police are not overpowered, in any way. The secret service taps pretty whatever they want. They just can't use the information, except for domestic terrorist or foreign issues. In other words: they can know, but if they arrest you, based on this information and a judge does not convict you for terrorism, it's harassment. I just want to extend this setup for organised crime. It's ok to use a satellite, to track which country the 250 stolen cars go to, for example.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;I did read up on the gun thing (thinking about moving there), and it looks like ownership is allowed, but controlled. I like guns, but shipping them internationally is probably a major headache.&#10;&#10;Ownership is allowed. But your gun must be in a box at all times, unless at a shooting range. A non automatic rifle is another story. That's ok, that's for hunting. &#10;&#10;But you &quot;liking guns&quot; is the biggest problem. That means the secret service and the police will put you on a list, and track everything you do. People that like guns are generally considered paranoid dangerous nutjobs, and the majority of people would actually like to 'preventively' lock these people up.&#10;&#10;I'm not saying I agree, but &quot;i like guns&quot; is socially not that far removed from &quot;i like raping children&quot; here. However, if you continue asking, the image people have of guns is _handguns_ and automatic firing mass-murder horror movie stuff. It's not hunting rifles. &#10;&#10;Most people here have never ever seen a real gun in real life. They only see them on TV. American shows. Cops, horror movies, etc. Whenever they see a gun, they see death, they see killing, they see murders. So, their vision is not based on reality.&#10;&#10;The fact that it is still legal to own a gun, is that we really don't like to outlaw things. But we've had a 'highschool' style shooting (except at a mall, but same thing), by a dangerous idiot (a schizofrenic) that was able to get a gun legally. So, people have been turned a bit on this issue. &#10;&#10;Honestly, if you are serious about moving to holland, I would just give that hobby up or turn it into 'hunting wildlife' (which is strictly controlled: the government tells the hunters what to shoot, and how much, and if they don't shoot exactly that, they loose their liscence to carry a rifle). This happens only in small towns, where you have one to three hunters, that do this in collaboration with the gov. Generally, they don't just hunt, they also advice the government, and count the animal population and things like that. They are the shephards of our nature, and they have a special status. (for example: the police will often ask their assistance, and gov. nature planners will ask their advice)  &#10;&#10;This may all sound very weird for an american, where somebody's legal position and standing is very clear, and very hierarchical. Here, everyone is pretty much equal, and people that are more useful for society get perks unofficially. Our politicians (with the exception of just one, that keeps insulting the islam) do not have bodyguards, and you can approach them anywhere, including in the train or in the bus, or when they are riding their bike to work. They'll answer pretty anything somebody asks on twitter themselves. &#10;&#10;We're not as distrustful of each other, as americans are, and nobody is unapproachable. &#10;&#10;I believe the reason for this, is very simple. Scale and history. We're a small country, with a history of other people trying to rule us, and us sabotaging them secretely. You can not operate uni-lateral in Holland. Everybody needs everybody's cooperation, for every thing.&#10;&#10;Laws are seen as 'advice' and 'guidelines', not just by the people, but even by the police and judges. We even have a law that states that minor offensives and general disobiedence are legal, if they are either politically motivated (&quot;make a statement&quot;) or are based on human-decency. No law can force a person to hurt someone, for example. &#10;&#10;Oh, this is a nice one. A police officer can not order people around. They can ask friendly, but not doing what they tell you, is not grounds for an arrest. So, the tone of voice is completely different: it's more like a negotiation in many cases.&#10;&#10;Have you ever seen two dutch people meet in the US? Do they act like they've known each other for years, and are sharing, in the eyes of an american intimate details about their life within seconds? That they are incredible honest, and direct with each other? &#10;&#10;I can imagine people thinking it's one big cult. If the US is a war-society, holland is a consensus-society. Bosses are boss, because everyone likes them, otherwise they would just fail at their job. If you think a dutch boss is wrong, you can just say 'you are an idiot, it doesnt work like that'. That's perfectly fine. Unless most co-workers agree you are an asshole, you won't get fired. But if everybody hates you, the boss is the one that needs to fire you. It's not that all bosses are nice, but all succesfull ones are. It's the completely opposite of managing americans, where being a dick is the path to the best result. &#10;&#10;In the same way, owning a gun, is a kind of unilateral action, where your neighbours will literally be like 'you should have talked about it to us first'. &#10;&#10;You have to understand, this is part of our history. What somebody does with ground (and water-level!) on place X, affects the ground on place Y. So, consensus has always been the general path. The best method to get your way, is to talk honestly about your priorities and problems. Often there is a path, where everyone gets what they want. A trade-off that is much better for everyone, but much more context-specific, too nuanced to fit in a law.&#10;&#10;For example: extreme religious groups feel fine with atheist getting gay married. It does not concern them. But to a gay pride parade, in their neighbourhood, they take offense, so that doesn't happen. Live and let live, everything is a negotiation between friends .. and preventing someone from doing something that does not concern you, just because you have an opinion is considered to be fascist. They'll call you a bad name for a german. Or these days, compare you to an american. &#10;&#10;The things a typical republican, but even a democrat would say, and their tone of voice, just sounds like 'i am your enemy, kill me' to most dutch citizen. You know when the US dropped in popularity around the world, but esspecially in Holland? When Bush said &quot;If you are not with us, you are against us&quot; .. while he looked like an aggressive dog that should be put down. 17 million people (the population of Holland) all thought at the same time 'You do not talk to me like that. Go fuck yourself.'&#10;" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt;  In holland you can tell a police officer to fuck himself, and that's legal. If he would arrest you in response, it's harassment and he will loose his job. &#10;&#10;over here, you'd get roughed up and people would say you had it coming.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt; But you &quot;liking guns&quot; is the biggest problem. That means the secret service and the police will put you on a list, and track everything you do. People that like guns are generally considered paranoid dangerous nutjobs, and the majority of people would actually like to 'preventively' lock these people up.&#10;&#10;I also like snowboards - would that put me on a list too? :p It's not like I beat off to guns and ammo...&#10;&#10;&amp;gt; Honestly, if you are serious about moving to holland, I would just give that hobby up or turn it into 'hunting wildlife' &#10;&#10;yeah, I was thinking of that. The guns are in a locked box already and only come out when going to the range. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt; When Bush said &quot;If you are not with us, you are against us&quot; .. while he looked like an aggressive dog that should be put down.&#10;&#10;yeah, he really did, didn't he?" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt;I also like snowboards - would that put me on a list too? &#10;&#10;Nope. But if you have guns in your house, even legally, they'll check you out. If say, you are very anti-muslim, or very anti-west .. or an animal-activist, they'll start actively monitoring you. They are afraid of politically motivated violence, that destabilizes society. &#10;&#10;They are not worried you just like guns. They are worried you can't control your emotions, have strong political convictions and the ability and skill to use a weapon. As you would say in the US, &quot;guns dont kill people, people do&quot;. ... we would add to that &quot;people with proper training and access to guns do&quot;. It's not about the weapon of choice, it's about the investment in the ability to inflict violence. We naturally ask &quot;why, what are you planning to do?&quot;&#10;&#10;In a country, so dense, a police helicopter can be at your location within 15 minutes, 'defense' is not an acceptable answer.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;yeah, I was thinking of that. The guns are in a locked box already and only come out when going to the range.&#10;&#10;So, thats legal. But with a special permit and everything. You are not _playing_ with guns, you are _practising_ with guns, perhaps because of a professional reason (you are a soldier or a police officer). It has to be really boring and adult-like.&#10;&#10;The typical american right to form a militia, run around naked in your backyard wearing only an american flag, while firing guns at in the sky .. We don't distinguish between that and a domestic terrorist. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;yeah, he really did, didn't he?&#10;&#10;The only redeeming factor, is that because we all super-consume american media, we are aware that this tone of voice is sort of how americans talk to each other. It's never 'This is private property, please don't enter this land without an invitation'. It's always 'Trespassers will get shot'. " />

          <attvalue for="0" value="&amp;gt;over here, you'd get roughed up and people would say you had it coming.&#10;&#10;To be fair, this is a topic of discussion here as well. But 'rough you up' is out of the question. They are working on laws, that would allow the police officer to fine you in such a case. &#10;&#10;But people will not think 'you had it coming'. For starters, you are the one paying the salary of the policeman. So if I see a police man walking, I see my employee walking. He should be grateful we give him this job, and he should try to do his best.&#10;&#10;Off course, that's no reason to be a dick. But most people who are, generally are emotionally disturbed, at least at that very moment, and in the light of that, don't need to be 'suppressed' just because Mr Policeman has a fragile ego. He's a professional, he should know how to take it. He should be the rational adult one, in every situation. &#10;&#10;Shit, if you tell a waitress to go fuck herself, can she then rough you up? Can the staff come out, and kick the crap out of you? Exactly. What makes Mr Policeman so special? He's a servant, a professional, doing his job.&#10;&#10;And answering verbal violence with physical violence, just proves one thing. That the one using physical violence is less civilized, more like an animal. In general, anybody who reacts with physical violence in response to verbal violence is considered to be 'less than human', and like a dog, we would prefer people like that be on a leech, in control of an actual adult.

What else could it be, after all?&#10;&#10;So, happiness is good. The idea of welfare is to increase happiness, yeah? It's possible that the way welfare works (or welfare at all) is not the most efficient way to increase happiness. For example, the resources allocated for the welfare system could be used for medical research. Let's say a cure for cancer arises from that. Let's say we discover fusion power.&#10;&#10;So, let's say for the sake of this hypothetical that it has been proven that the money spent on welfare could be better spent on things that will increase the overall happiness more. Let's say that the welfare system actually *is* being taken advantage of people who are unwilling to work. (There's a historical precedence for this; the grain dole in Rome.) So what I've described is certainly possible.&#10;&#10;Under these paramters, would you still agree with your saying that a society should be judged by how it treats is smallest citizens (or however you put it).

I never met a single person with two jobs, for example. Nor do I know a single person looking for a job for more than a month. Our standard work week is 36 hours. There is not a place in the world, where people with a job, work less. &#10;&#10;No, here .. it's about 'space' and 'culture'. Honestly, it's about ugly screwups finding somebody even worse off to look down upon.&#10;&#10;The truth is, it's all bullshit. I don't know about the american situation, but to blame an uneducated, undeveloped immigrant for trying to feed his kids .. .. seriously, you can't find somebody else to blame for problem X?&#10;&#10;Because it's not the immigrants that are causing the economic situation in the US. It's not even really a situation, its just a matter of the 'elite' fucking it up, and shifting the problem to the middle and lower class.&#10;&#10;You know why they should tax the rich more? Because they are the ones that are not properly motivated to solve the problem. They break you pay. Why would they even try to fix it? If they make a profit, they get to keep it, but if they blow up your economy, it's your problem? What's their motivation, if whatever they break, you pay?&#10;&#10;Immigrants don't &quot;steal&quot; jobs. Jobs is not a finite supply thing. If i'm a company and can take a person, and make money off the labour of that person, then I can take two persons, and make twice as much money. &#10;&#10;Jobs go where people are. Yes, they are not going to mexico (because its corrupt). But they aren't going to the US either. They are going to China and Germany, at the moment. One country keeping wages low and treating people like slaves. You don't want those kind of jobs. And the other country making sure, a large majority of their population is highly educated, so they can do things cheap chinese workers can not. (our economy in Holland is heavily influenced by Germany, since they are our biggest export partner: if they do well, we do well)&#10;&#10;That's the thing. You don't solve problems with a Czar. Or a war. Or playing a blame-game. You solve it by making sure we either all drown or we all swim. If we start cannibalizing each other, none of us will have a future.&#10;&#10;Here we have you, and this poor immigrant, and you blame each other. Who's the guy laughing and manipulating you into this position? Who's is the one that is getting richer because of the problems? At least one of those types of people is running for president in your country right now.&#10;&#10;It's not a conspiracy if it is this obvious. You are being played. Money doesn't trickle down. The day you start hating on people that have it even worse than you, is the day the people who have it better laugh and know they won. If society is a ladder, you should always look up, not down. The immigrant is not making the world into whatever he/she sees fit, the elite is. It would be like blaming the a mosquito for being eaten by a lion. Blame those who make the choices, not the ones trying to survive those choices. " />

Are these politicians funded by people like you? Or funded by the immigrants? Funded by drugs-dealers? Or maybe, just maybe these people are funded by very rich, pretty immoral companies. &#10;&#10;Just a guess.

Okay, let's say it's happiness. What else could it be, after all?&#10;&#10;You've got to be joking. Good already has a definition. That definition is not happiness. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/good That's some projecting you're doing about the relationship between the concept of good and happiness right there. Don't try to argue in simple terms when the issues are not remotely simple.&#10;&amp;gt;The idea of welfare is to increase happiness, yeah?&#10;&#10;No, the idea of welfare is that every member of society has a certain minimum standard of living and opportunity. Obviously that promotes a higher degree of happiness, but it's not the actual point. A huge part of the point of welfare is to create a certain level of stability in a society. A society without social unrest, and a society with enhanced opportunity for those where otherwise there would be little.&#10;&amp;gt;It's possible that the way welfare works (or welfare at all) is not the most efficient way to increase happiness.&#10;&#10;Give any actual example that isn't a grand unproven experiment, pipe dream, or more than 1600 years old, and one that wasn't at the cost of social stability. Also you're ignoring the arguments I bring up.&#10;&amp;gt;For example, the resources allocated for the welfare system could be used for medical research. Let's say a cure for cancer arises from that. Let's say we discover fusion power.&#10;&#10;That's a totally irrelevant conclusion. It's an extremely hopeful grand plan. What if nothing happens but more corruption in the system and only a slow incremental increase in technology? What if, what if? In a no welfare state the wealthiest would reap the largest benefits, especially considering initial medical advancements. Also, consider until any advancement happens that affects them in any meaningful way, the most in need remain in a state of no government assistance. That society doesn't give food; it prosecutes those who steal it.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;So, let's say for the sake of this hypothetical that it has been proven that the money spent on welfare could be better spent on things that will increase the overall happiness more. Let's say that the welfare system actually is being taken advantage of people who are unwilling to work.&#10;&#10;Those hypotheticals that could challenge any belief whatsoever...  totally unrealistic hypotheticals. *Slow clap* Welfare abuse that isn't minor is much more rare than commonly assumed. A lot of the errors reported are counted as fraud and can even come from unintentional recipient errors and employee errors, so not really fraud at all. Only 1.9% of UI benefits in the US in 2001 were considered fraud. 0.5% of reviewed welfare recipients in Australia are actually prosecuted. In the UK about 1% of beneficiaries were determined to have committed fraud. Over payments have to be repaid in most circumstances. Fraud cases do also actually get prosecuted with restitution.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;Under these paramters, would you still agree with your saying that a society should be judged by how it treats is smallest citizens (or however you put it). If so, then I call your belief arbitrary, but I'd be interested to hear your defense of it.&#10;&#10;Yes, I still believe in taking care of the vulnerable people in society. You'd be an idiot to challenge me and believe in anything, yet you already have admitted belief in your previous responses. &#10;&#10;&#10;I know what you're trying to do. You're attempting to question my beliefs by way of applying a regressive argument where anything **can** be called arbitrary even the most fundamental beliefs that anyone has ever believed. In the operational world this skepticism serves very little actual purpose other than as a thought exercise. Yes, I chose to believe in something rather than nothing, but I also live and my actions influence the people and world around me. That is a fact that is true in and of itself. You're a fool to attempt to win an argument through this kind of reasoning because of that. The rewards for belief and the change that can be made could actually be substantive when considering the experience we have in our human life. Your attempt is literally nothing. It's juvenile. You have no real world point. You have no real world argument, but you're questioning real world solutions to problems without anything sensical. I'm not interested in a conversation where you suggest I consider whether I exist or not. That thinking is irrelevant and unhelpful in this situation. It is pointless to me to argue without any anchor point at all. I suggest you take in whatever surrounding you are in right now and think hard about it. " />

It just so happens it's not a question you wanted to discuss.&#10;&#10;Well, fuck you if you don't want to discuss it. You're acting like IT IS NOT POSSIBLE that the money spent on welfare is wasted and not willing to consider the point I am making about how it hypothetically may be. And you call *me* juvenile.&#10;&#10;I'm playing devil's advocate. I do happen to believe in welfare, you know. I also thinking insisting on welfare in spite of hypothetical evidence contradicting its effectiveness is arbitrary.&#10;&#10;Anyway, surprise, surprise, some angry neckbeard on Reddit doesn't want to have a real conversation about differing points of view.&#10;&#10;You can respond to this if you want, but I'm not particularly interested in continuing this conversation with you, so I'll leave you with a hearty &quot;go fuck yourself&quot; and move on.

You are also obviously full of tact, tactful is you. Should I reply in kind with some derogatory statement about women, like how it must be that time of the month? I can understand why through text only communication you could assume I was mad or angry in some way. That wasn't the case. I was harsh at points, but I thought it was necessary to get the point across. In the end you didn't get my point or avoided it. You do seem emotional over the conversation, however. I wish it served a good purpose. Hopefully it made you feel better at least to swear at me, really I do. &#10;&#10;You needn't explain yourself in terms of playing devil's advocate, or challenging my beliefs, I understand what you're doing. &#10;&#10;Your regress argument questioning my belief was never going to be entertained seriously. I made that obvious. Every conversation you use a regress argument will be very similar. &quot;If horses could fly at incredibly fast speeds would we still have invented the airplane? What if we made space suits for them and could travel to other planets on horses?&quot; One **could** literally make up anything and call it hypothetical and valid. The chain could be endless. &quot;What if the world was the opposite, then would you believe the same thing?&quot; Of course not, but I refuse to have that conversation.  I feel it's a waste of time because it doesn't prove anything. The world is this way. Our conversation started about the real world. I could chose to believe in nothing because I could be wrong. I don't. I chose to believe in Humanism because in our real world I believe it to be the best for humanity. Only people who promote suffering would have beliefs against it. I've said you could call anybody's beliefs arbitrary as a thought exercise but it serves no real purpose other than for you to **save face**. It's a cop out to &quot;win&quot; a conversation. You've avoided many more issues and points than I have in favor of attempting to control the conversation. This has nothing to do with me not accepting hypotheticals. It's the type of argument you're using. Every belief and any belief could be called arbitrary this isn't some discovery you've stumbled upon but it is totally and completely frivolous.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;I'm not saying it is the case. I'm saying, if it was, would your views change? And if not, why? My (confirmed) suspicion was that you'd stick to your guns on that one without having a really good reason for it. Which is understandable; that's how most people view morality. &quot;What if randomly hurting people ultimately caused more happiness than not? Does it become ethical or unethical to randomly hurt people in this scenario?&quot;&#10;&#10;Suspicion not confirmed. You didn't read very carefully. I can accept that in a different universe some solution other than social welfare could be more beneficial, but I still believe the most vulnerable should be taken care of. The issue isn't black and white. It's not only one or the other no matter how you look at it. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;And the reason for this standard of living would be... what? Something other than happiness?&#10;&#10;See you've got to actually read what I type. I already explained my position on this a couple of times. I even addressed it in regards to happiness. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;doesn't want to have a real conversation about differing points of view.&#10;&#10;You mean don't want to have a person make up hypothetical situations for me to argue against? Where there are no facts. Where you control the conversation and there is very little relevance to the original conversation. &#10;&#10;&amp;gt;I'm playing devil's advocate. I do happen to believe in welfare, you know. I also thinking insisting on welfare in spite of hypothetical evidence contradicting its effectiveness is arbitrary.&#10;&#10;There is no such thing as hypothetical evidence. It's not evidence it's what ifs. I've rejected the majority of your hypothetical &quot;arguments&quot; as not fit to argue. I'm a participant here just like you. You make up hypothetical scenarios in order to challenge instead of ever giving a viable example of what's better than social welfare. If you'd have given a viable real world example/idea we would have been discussing that instead of the waste of time distraction conversation about my belief. Seriously, at least come up with better hypotheticals if you're going to insist on them being the foundation of your argument.&#10;&#10;Please at least glance at these links:&#10;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regress_argument&#10;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_hypothesis&#10;&#10;P.S.

Only if I didnt know it should be there, would it reflect upon my intelligence. Rather, it speaks to how much I care about perfect grammar while posting on the internet. I maintain proper spelling, correct usage of homonyms, proper capitalization and use of punctuation. But I dont exactly care about apostrophes all that much when Im simply posting on the internet. You should be able to figure out what I mean.&#10;&#10;&amp;gt;More fucked up than telling someone like a Jew in a concentration camp or any random Chinese peasant in northern China during the Mongols that they deserve what they never signed up for but nonetheless have coming to them?&#10;&#10;More? Eh idk, its about the same. Both pretty fucked up. &#10;&#10;What I think is pretty ridiculous, is that youre going to sit here and debate with me what level of fucked up this is.

They'd also tell you that soldiers don't exist without civilians and that soldiers do not remain soldiers for their entire lives.
